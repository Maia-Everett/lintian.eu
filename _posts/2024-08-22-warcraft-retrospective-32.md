As we saw [last time](/2024/07/27/warcraft-retrospective-31/), much of the expansion night elf campaign, especially the second half, might as well not have existed. Sure, it introduced Maiev, a now-iconic character, and the Broken Isles, which later became the setting of a well-liked expansion (albeit in a *heavily* retconned form), but most of the events of this campaign specifically are never mentioned again in later Warcraft lore.

The events of the *next* campaign, however, became very important and foundational to Warcraft lore as we know it now.

We're embarking on the so-called "Alliance" campaign. I say "so-called" because, as we'll see, we'll only be playing the actual Alliance tech tree in the first mission, and in the rest of them we'll have custom, campaign-only tech trees. It's interesting to note that in Reign of Chaos, the campaigns were named the human, undead, orc, and night elf campaigns, while where, we have the Sentinel, Alliance, and Scourge campaigns. I wonder if this campaign is the reason: calling it a human campaign will be blatant false advertising.

The end result is that people who were expecting a more traditional Alliance campaign, perhaps focusing on Jaina's Alliance-in-exile in Kalimdor, are going to be disappointed. To learn what *that* group has been up to, we'll have to turn to the *orc* campaign, which is completely disconnected from the main story.

Instead, we'll be focusing on Kael'thas and his blood elves, who begin the story as part of the Alliance remnant in a ruined Lordaeron.


## Misconceptions

{% figure [caption:"Ah, so it seems this campaign begins very shortly after the night elf one."] %}

At the ruins of Dalaran, Kael and his men are having a meeting with [Grand Marshal Garithos](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Othmar_Garithos)[^garithos], the leader of the remaining Alliance military in Lordaeron, who opens with a disparaging remark towards elves in general.

{% figure [caption:"At least they didn't give him a toothbrush moustache."] %}
![Misconceptions](/assets/wr/20240727165155_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Garithos has no redeeming qualities. He's a racist, incompetent, oafish, racist, weak-minded, arrogant, racist, tactically-suicidal, jerkass racist. In a story full of [anti-heroes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero) and [villain protagonists](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist), he exists as a character the players can [totally, unambiguously hate](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink) --- and fulfills that role well, being one of the most despised characters in the entire Warcraft franchise. It's important to note that we hate and despise him as a *person*, because of his personality and actions; this is Classic Blizzard, not Twilight Blizzard, where we hate *the writers* for portraying characters a certain way. Garithos is *intentionally* loathsome, whereas despised characters in Twilight era WoW end up [despised unintentionally because of bad writing](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy).

Garithos has received a report that the undead have begun a new offensive to retake Dalaran, and he'll be leaving for the front immediately. Kael is eager to go with him, but Garithos instead assigns him to repairing the observatories. That's right, he's using his highly skilled warriors and mages as manual labor, and as we'll see, it's only thanks to a chance meeting that this mission doesn't end in total disaster.

Once the cutscene ends, we gain control of Kael and a few units.

{% figure [caption:"Kael's unit icon is just so hilariously derpy."] %}

I like Kael's character design (except for the three green orbs floating around him for some reason). His portrait's facial features show that we're not dealing with a goody-to-shoes hero here, but a desperate man resorting to desperate measures. His voice sells this impression, too. It fits the overall despairing tone of this entire campaign, which takes place among charred ruins and you have to build your future from whatever scraps you find.

And the background music perfectly fits the tone of the campaign as well.

It encapsulates the state of the Alliance: it has fallen on hard times, and whole nations lie in ruins, but its spirit endures. It mixes in desperation, dignity, and resolve. And intentional or not, YouTube commenter @nausherwanbabry identifies parts of this theme with going through the Seven Kingdoms in order: Lordaeron, Stromgarde, Stormwind, Alterac, Dalaran, Gilneas, and finally, Kul Tiras.

The mission takes place among the ruins of Dalaran, amid desolation wrought by the Scourge. A lone peasant is repairing the first observatory while we explore the eastern, urban section with our starting troops. Kael is a [blood mage](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Blood_mage) starting with Flame Strike, a telegraphed AoE, and Banish, which makes a unit temporarily unable to attack while also making it temporarily immune to physical damage (but taking extra damage from spells). Flame Strike pairs well with the new unit, the [spell breaker](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Spellbreaker), which is immune to magic and thus can stand safely in Flame Strike's area of effect.

...Which would be well and good, except you also have footmen, who are *not* immune to magic. So you still have to be cautious about positioning your units.

Spell breakers are... okay. They're a rather awkward combination of frontliner and tech; their selling point is Spellsteal, which automatically redirects enemy buffs to your units and your debuffs to enemy units. They also have Control Magic, which can take control of an enemy summoned unit by spending its HP in mana. There's actually a scripted scene to educate you on its use, where a rogue wizard summons a water elemental. Unfortunately, because of balance changes since the campaign was made, you can now only take control of a *wounded* water elemental, which the encounter doesn't explain; a spell breaker doesn't have enough mana to steal a full-health elemental.

You're fighting mostly bandits (including rogue wizards), mutants, and demons. There's also a side quest to dig up supply caches.

{% figure [caption:"Once again, the game educates you in a mechanic (namely that Flame Strike can destroy trees) by making you use it to complete a quest objective."] %}
![Misconceptions](/assets/wr/20240727170421_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

The caches contain tiny versions of a town hall, barracks and altar of kings. When placed by a hero, these items quickly construct the corresponding buildings. It looks like we'll be building a base here. And indeed, once the first observatory is repaired, it reveals a large island with a gold mine, populated by creeps.

Except Kael has no means to get there, as the undead have burned down the local shipyard. Unsure what to do, Kael has a surprise encounter with... Illidan's naga!

{% figure [caption:"Beware Highborne bearing gifts."] %}
![Misconceptions](/assets/wr/20240727170735_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Vashj clarifies that with Illidan gone, the naga are no longer following him, and are on their own. The two races share a common ancestry, and the undead are their mutual enemies, so Vashj brings two transport ships as gifts, for free, to help Kael and his men cross the water.

We do just that, and immediately construct a rudimentary base from Kael's inventory.

{% endfigure %}

...And because we're still exceeding the food cap, I have to ferry the lone peasant who was repairing the observatory, so he can build some farms. Next we properly build up the base, constructing secondary buildings and clearing troll creeps (and their little dogs, too) from the island while fending off small undead attacks, and while also repairing the second observatory.

Yes, I have to say it, I like this mission for its atmosphere, but it's kind of a drag. You *have* to build up your forces because the last observatory is protected by a tough boss, but you have to develop a base almost from scratch. It's not as tiresome as Beyond the Dark Portal, where you often started with just peasants mission after mission, but it's a departure from the overall faster pace of Warcraft 3.

Repairing the second observatory reveals an undead base on the same island, across the narrow strait. I build up an army and destroy it, which is straightforward.

{% figure [caption:"I actually got overly bold and had Kael killed, but the rest of my forces held long enough to finish the job with incoming reinforcements. I started constructing an expansion without waiting for them to raze absolutely everything."] %}
![Misconceptions](/assets/wr/20240821204324_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

The main threat is gone, but we still have one observatory to repair. There's now no time pressure whatsoever, so I sailed around the map, killing the remaining creeps (gnolls and ogres) and taking their stuff before bringing an army of peasants to repair the third observatory in record time.

{% figure [caption:"There is power, there is power in a band of working men!"] %}
![Misconceptions](/assets/wr/20240821210318_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

With the observatories repaired, Garithos returns. You'd think he'd be glad Kael completed his assigned task, but well, this is *Garithos* we're talking about. He received word of him consorting with the "vile" naga.

{% figure [caption:"I don't know, if I was Kael's commanding officer, I'd commend him for making effective use of unconventional allies."] %}
![Misconceptions](/assets/wr/20240821210413_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

For now, Garithos leaves Kael with just a warning. For now.


## A Dark Covenant

## The Dungeons of Dalaran

Next up: we find out where the portal actually leads!


[^garithos]: As we know from later lore, his first name is Othmar. At this point I'm convinced that fantasy sounding names like Arthas, Terenas, Othmar Garithos and Tirion Fordring are reserved for Lordaeronian royalty and nobility, while commoners have names like Mike, Scott, and Stephanie.
