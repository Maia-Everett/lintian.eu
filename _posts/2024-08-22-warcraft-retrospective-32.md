As we saw [last time](/2024/07/27/warcraft-retrospective-31/), much of the expansion night elf campaign, especially the second half, might as well not have existed. Sure, it introduced Maiev, a now-iconic character, and the Broken Isles, which later became the setting of a well-liked expansion (albeit in a *heavily* retconned form), but most of the events of this campaign specifically are never mentioned again in later Warcraft lore.

The events of the *next* campaign, however, became very important and foundational to Warcraft lore as we know it now.

We're embarking on the so-called "Alliance" campaign. I say "so-called" because, as we'll see, we'll only be playing the actual Alliance tech tree in the first mission, and in the rest of them we'll have custom, campaign-only tech trees. It's interesting to note that in Reign of Chaos, the campaigns were named the human, undead, orc, and night elf campaigns, while where, we have the Sentinel, Alliance, and Scourge campaigns. I wonder if this campaign is the reason: calling it a human campaign will be blatant false advertising.

The end result is that people who were expecting a more traditional Alliance campaign, perhaps focusing on Jaina's Alliance-in-exile in Kalimdor, are going to be disappointed. To learn what *that* group has been up to, we'll have to turn to the *orc* campaign, which is completely disconnected from the main story.

Instead, we'll be focusing on Kael'thas and his blood elves, who begin the story as part of the Alliance remnant in a ruined Lordaeron.


## Misconceptions

{% figure [caption:"Ah, so it seems this campaign begins very shortly after the night elf one."] %}

{% endfigure %}

At the ruins of Dalaran, Kael and his men are having a meeting with [Grand Marshal Garithos](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Othmar_Garithos)[^garithos], the leader of the remaining Alliance military in Lordaeron, who opens with a disparaging remark towards elves in general.

{% figure [caption:"At least they didn't give him a toothbrush moustache."] %}
![Misconceptions](/assets/wr/20240727165155_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Garithos has no redeeming qualities. He's a racist, incompetent, oafish, racist, weak-minded, arrogant, racist, tactically-suicidal, jerkass racist. In a story full of [anti-heroes](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AntiHero) and [villain protagonists](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VillainProtagonist), he exists as a character the players can [totally, unambiguously hate](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HateSink) --- and fulfills that role well, being one of the most despised characters in the entire Warcraft franchise. It's important to note that we hate and despise him as a *person*, because of his personality and actions; this is Classic Blizzard, not Twilight Blizzard, where we hate *the writers* for portraying characters a certain way. Garithos is *intentionally* loathsome, whereas despised characters in Twilight era WoW end up [despised unintentionally because of bad writing](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheScrappy).

Garithos has received a report that the undead have begun a new offensive to retake Dalaran, and he'll be leaving for the front immediately. Kael is eager to go with him, but Garithos instead assigns him to repairing the observatories. That's right, he's using his highly skilled warriors and mages as manual labor, and as we'll see, it's only thanks to a chance meeting that this mission doesn't end in total disaster.

Once the cutscene ends, we gain control of Kael and a few units.

{% figure [caption:"Kael's unit icon is just so hilariously derpy."] %}
![Misconceptions](/assets/wr/20240727165422_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

I like Kael's character design (except for the three green orbs floating around him for some reason). His portrait's facial features show that we're not dealing with a goody-to-shoes hero here, but a desperate man resorting to desperate measures. His voice sells this impression, too. It fits the overall despairing tone of this entire campaign, which takes place among charred ruins and you have to build your future from whatever scraps you find.

And the background music perfectly fits the tone of the campaign as well.

{% youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7Z38j7kwtU" %}

It encapsulates the state of the Alliance: it has fallen on hard times, and whole nations lie in ruins, but its spirit endures. It mixes in desperation, dignity, and resolve. And intentional or not, YouTube commenter @nausherwanbabry identifies parts of this theme with going through the Seven Kingdoms in order: Lordaeron, Stromgarde, Stormwind, Alterac, Dalaran, Gilneas, and finally, Kul Tiras.

The mission takes place among the ruins of Dalaran, amid desolation wrought by the Scourge. A lone peasant is repairing the first observatory while we explore the eastern, urban section with our starting troops. Kael is a [blood mage](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Blood_mage) starting with Flame Strike, a telegraphed AoE, and Banish, which makes a unit temporarily unable to attack while also making it temporarily immune to physical damage (but taking extra damage from spells). Flame Strike pairs well with the new unit, the [spell breaker](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Spellbreaker), which is immune to magic and thus can stand safely in Flame Strike's area of effect.

...Which would be well and good, except you also have footmen, who are *not* immune to magic. So you still have to be cautious about positioning your units.

Spell breakers are... okay. They're a rather awkward combination of frontliner and tech; their selling point is Spellsteal, which automatically redirects enemy buffs to your units and your debuffs to enemy units. They also have Control Magic, which can take control of an enemy summoned unit by spending its HP in mana. There's actually a scripted scene to educate you on its use, where a rogue wizard summons a water elemental. Unfortunately, because of balance changes since the campaign was made, you can now only take control of a *wounded* water elemental, which the encounter doesn't explain; a spell breaker doesn't have enough mana to steal a full-health elemental.

You're fighting mostly bandits (including rogue wizards), mutants, and demons. There's also a side quest to dig up supply caches.

{% figure [caption:"Once again, the game educates you in a mechanic (namely that Flame Strike can destroy trees) by making you use it to complete a quest objective."] %}
![Misconceptions](/assets/wr/20240727170421_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

The caches contain tiny versions of a town hall, barracks and altar of kings. When placed by a hero, these items quickly construct the corresponding buildings. It looks like we'll be building a base here. And indeed, once the first observatory is repaired, it reveals a large island with a gold mine, populated by creeps.

Except Kael has no means to get there, as the undead have burned down the local shipyard. Unsure what to do, Kael has a surprise encounter with... Illidan's naga!

{% figure [caption:"Beware Highborne bearing gifts."] %}
![Misconceptions](/assets/wr/20240727170735_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Vashj clarifies that with Illidan gone, the naga are no longer following him, and are on their own. The two races share a common ancestry, and the undead are their mutual enemies, so Vashj brings two transport ships as gifts, for free, to help Kael and his men cross the water.

We do just that, and immediately construct a rudimentary base from Kael's inventory.

{% figure [caption:"The precursor to the Town-in-a-Box."] %}
![Misconceptions](/assets/wr/20240727171359_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

...And because we're still exceeding the food cap, I have to ferry the lone peasant who was repairing the observatory, so he can build some farms. Next we properly build up the base, constructing secondary buildings and clearing troll creeps (and their little dogs, too) from the island while fending off small undead attacks, and while also repairing the second observatory.

Yes, I have to say it, I like this mission for its atmosphere, but it's kind of a drag. You *have* to build up your forces because the last observatory is protected by a tough boss, but you have to develop a base almost from scratch. It's not as tiresome as Beyond the Dark Portal, where you often started with just peasants mission after mission, but it's a departure from the overall faster pace of Warcraft 3.

Repairing the second observatory reveals an undead base on the same island, across the narrow strait. I build up an army and destroy it, which is straightforward.

{% figure [caption:"I actually got overly bold and had Kael killed, but the rest of my forces held long enough to finish the job with incoming reinforcements. I started constructing an expansion without waiting for them to raze absolutely everything."] %}
![Misconceptions](/assets/wr/20240821204324_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

The main threat is gone, but we still have one observatory to repair. There's now no time pressure whatsoever, so I sailed around the map, killing the remaining creeps (gnolls and ogres) and taking their stuff before bringing an army of peasants to repair the third observatory in record time.

{% figure [caption:"There is power, there is power in a band of working men!"] %}
![Misconceptions](/assets/wr/20240821210318_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

With the observatories repaired, Garithos returns. You'd think he'd be glad Kael completed his assigned task, but well, this is *Garithos* we're talking about. He received word of him consorting with the "vile" naga.

{% figure [caption:"I don't know, if I was Kael's commanding officer, I'd commend him for making effective use of unconventional allies."] %}
![Misconceptions](/assets/wr/20240821210413_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

For now, Garithos leaves Kael with just a warning. For now.


## A Dark Covenant

{% figure [caption:"Necrolords? Night Fae? Venthyr? Kyrian probably don't qualify as &ldquo;dark&rdquo;. Except figuratively."] %}
![A Dark Covenant](/assets/wr/20240821210446_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

An emissary arrives at Kael's camp. The observatories have detected a large undead force moving this way, and Garithos wants Kael to crush them. This doesn't sound too difficult, but... there's a catch.

{% figure [caption:"So whom *does* this leave out?"] %}
![A Dark Covenant](/assets/wr/20240821210523_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

The knights, riflemen, and mortar teams heed the emissary's words and move out. "This is preposterous!" exclaims Kael. "Am I to assault the undead with nothing but sticks and harsh language?"

{% figure [caption:"Only now?"] %}
![A Dark Covenant](/assets/wr/20240821210542_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

In a nice case of visual continuity, this mission takes place on a near-copy of the first mission's map, with the eastern urban portion gone and some new land in the west revealed.

{% figure [caption:"Easier said than done."] %}
![A Dark Covenant](/assets/wr/20240821210553_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

In the previous mission, you had access to the entire Alliance tech tree. Here, you're left with just the blood elves, so there's a grand total of *six* units you can build: the sorceress, priest and spell breaker, plus the dragonhawk rider (a new flying unit that specializes in anti-air) and the campaign-only blood elf swordsman (a reskinned footman) and archer (a recolored, well, archer). What's worse, the undead are advancing with an overwhelming force. Like in [Grom Hellscream's second mission](/2024/05/18/warcraft-retrospective-26/), at the beginning, all you can do is watch your outlying bases get pulverized into dust.

What's *worse* worse, your remaining base, on the island, has no gold mine.

At this dark hour, the naga once again bring much-needed help.

{% figure [caption:"They're being suspiciously generous."] %}
![A Dark Covenant](/assets/wr/20240821210921_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Kael has doubts, as Garithos would disapprove, but Vashj points out that he's not here. Besides, Kael doesn't have much of a choice.

This mission is reportedly *brutally hard* on hard difficulty because you have no siege units, are left against five bases, and the green base is enormous --- and constantly sending attacks your way, putting pressure on you to coordinate attack and defense at the same time. On normal difficulty, however, I found it pretty easy. I immediately besieged the easiest base to take --- the southeastern one --- and erect an expansion in its place.

{% figure [caption:"Naga units continue to be overpowered, especially the Royal Guard. This absolute beast with Chaos damage actually contributes more to the fights than the heroes!"] %}
![A Dark Covenant](/assets/wr/20240821211220_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Meanwhile, green is pestering my main base with aerial attacks, so I bring an army of workers to build a line of towers.

{% figure [caption:"When they stand (when they stand), hand in hand (hand in hand)!"] %}
![A Dark Covenant](/assets/wr/20240821211517_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

In this mission, I built mostly dragonhawks. They do okay damage, can immobilize enemy flyers (which is especially effective against frost wyrms), and can be rapidly redeployed between assaults on outlying bases and defense of the central one. They can also be sent from the island without using ships, which otherwise only the amphibious naga units can do.

I also build a few more priests to heal the naga units, as they're both powerful and irreplaceable.

Once all five outlying undead bases are destroyed, I assault the *huge* green base.

{% figure [caption:"Again, halfway through I lost both my heroes thanks to not paying much attention to micro, but the naga and dragonhawks finished the siege on their own. The myrmidons have nets to immobilize flyers, just like orc raiders."] %}
![A Dark Covenant](/assets/wr/20240821214305_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

The blood elves and naga celebrate victory... for now. Kael confides something to Vashj that is going to be very, *very* important to the overall franchise.

{% figure [caption:"Bending one's neck at that angle doesn't look very healthy."] %}
![A Dark Covenant](/assets/wr/20240821214622_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Vashj knows exactly what Kael is talking about. Like the naga, who are former Highborne, the blood elves are addicted to magic. It flowed through their veins for ten thousand years, and now, with the Sunwell destroyed and Quel'Thalas corrupted, its people are cut off from magic --- and will surely die unless a new source is found.

Magic addiction is familiar to us today and is a well-known element of the Warcraft setting, but back in 2003, it was a brand new development. From Warcraft 1 to Reign of Chaos, there was no evidence that magic was like a drug and being cut off from it could cause withdrawal; the worst you could say was that magic *users*, from Azshara to Antonidas, could sometimes be arrogant and too confident in their power, but that was not universally the case; Khadgar and Jaina were both characterized as decent people.

The introduction of magic addiction made the destruction of the Sunwell that much worse. Not only were the elves of Quel'Thalas cut off from their source of power; they were starving, and now their very survival depended on finding a replacement. On the other hand, it retroactively made the sacrifice of the night elves, who went cold turkey on magic after the Sundering, more justified and more poignant.

Vashj proposes demons as an alternate source of power, but Kael says they will never be that desperate. Before Vashj can retort, a spell breaker arrives.

{% figure [caption:"On top of everything else, Garithos needlessly parades his troops around."] %}
![A Dark Covenant](/assets/wr/20240821214718_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

The naga try to hide, but it's too late; Garithos's knights notice them retreating. The Grand Marshal himself makes a pronouncement from his high horse.

{% figure [caption:"Kael's pose makes it look like he's making some kind of light show performance."] %}
![A Dark Covenant](/assets/wr/20240821214759_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

I like the cinematography here, such as it is. Garithos is standing on a hill, and the scene is seen from a low angle with buildings in the distance. I wonder if it's an intentional throwback to Arthas in "The Culling". Like then, we have passed a point of no return; an arrogant, overzealous Alliance commander is accusing his subordinates of treason, and in doing so, sealing both their fate and, as we'll see much later, his own.

Kael tries to defend his men, saying that the decision to ally with the naga is his alone, but Garithos won't listen. The blood elves are arrested, disarmed, and taken away to...


## The Dungeons of Dalaran

{% figure [caption:"We know they won't be executed because they still have to get to that floaty islands land."] %}

## The Crossing

{% figure [caption:"I hope there aren't cows involved."] %}
![The Crossing](/assets/wr/20240821224517_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Next up: we find out where the portal actually leads!


[^garithos]: As we know from later lore, his first name is Othmar. At this point I'm convinced that fantasy sounding names like Arthas, Terenas, Othmar Garithos and Tirion Fordring are reserved for Lordaeronian royalty and nobility, while commoners have names like Mike, Scott, and Stephanie.
