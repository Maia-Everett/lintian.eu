Today we're looking at the rest of the Reign of Chaos manual, the factions we'll be seeing for the first time: the undead Scourge, night elf Sentinels, and demonic Burning Legion. The latter is a pure antagonist unplayable faction, though they were planned as playable at one point in Warcraft 3 development.

In the manual, these three factions are described in that order, but I'm going to talk about them in reverse order: demons first, then night elves, then undead. This way, we'll follow in-universe chronology and the chain of cause and effect, and see how one thing leads to another.

Speaking of cause and effect, now is a good time to talk about...

## So, Let's Recap...

The Titans ordered Azeroth, placing the Well of Eternity, a great source of magical power, at its center. This attracted the attention of Sargeras, a renegade Titan who assembled the Burning Legion to incinerate all creation. *Therefore*, the Legion tried to invade Azeroth, but was repelled by the night elves and their allies. Furion succeeded in sealing the way by destroying the Well of Eternity, *but* the resulting explosion destroyed much of the world's landmass, as well as the Kaldorei Empire.

*Therefore*, seeing the destructive potential of magic, Furion and the druids banned it in the reformed night elf society. *But* the high-borne disagreed with this decision and were *therefore* exiled. Dath'Remar led the high-borne exiles across the sea, where they founded Quel'Thalas on the eastern continent and eventually came into contact with the humans. Over time, the high-borne exiles changed physically, becoming the high elves.

And as we know from *The Last Guardian*, the Well of Eternity's energy wasn't destroyed --- rather, it dissipated across the world, creating an ambient magic field that its denizens could tap into. The humans studied magic too, and founded the magocracy of Dalaran, populated by both humans and high elves. However, magic still attracted demons to Azeroth, *therefore* the Order of Tirisfal was founded to safeguard the world from them.

*But* Sargeras didn't abandon his quest to conquer Azeroth, and hatched a plan. He sent an avatar of himself to Azeroth, then possessed Guardian Aegwynn's unborn child, who grew up into the next and final Guardian, Medivh. Having the Guardian's power and position at his disposal, Sargeras-as-Medivh opened the Dark Portal, leading the orcs into Azeroth --- the orcs who themselves were corrupted by the Burning Legion through Gul'dan and his warlocks.

The orcs fought the Alliance, but were eventually defeated and put into internment camps. Thrall matured in captivity, roused his people and reformed the Horde, laying low avoiding new conflict with the Alliance for now. *But* the Legion found a new use for Ner'zhul, turning him into the Lich King. And as long as Dalaran existed, there would be mages trying to push the boundaries of knowledge, even if it meant delving into forbidden dark arts. Kel'Thuzad was driven by a desire to understand the necromantic magics originally taught to the orcs by Gul'dan --- and ended up being recruited by the Lich King.

For a pulpy video game world, this is really well thought out. One historical event flows into another, and you can see the tragic inevitability of it all. It also organically builds on the material that came before. We knew the orcs of Warcraft 1 consorted with demons, and we knew about Kil'jaeden and Sargeras, and the latter's connection to Medivh, since Warcraft 2.

And there's a theme emerging. We see, again and again, how the road to ruin, both personal and world-shaking, is paved with good intentions. This will be a prevalent theme in Warcraft 3 itself, too.

It's certainly better than suddenly introducing a new villain you never heard of and claiming he was secretly behind everything all this time.


## What's Next?

Now that we've gone through the manual, we're going to actually play through the Warcraft 3: Reign of Chaos storyline.

Next up: the prologue campaign, Exodus of the Horde. One guess what happens in it.
