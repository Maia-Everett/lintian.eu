Today I pushed a really important update to Chaos Archives. It's almost invisible to users of *Chaos* Archives themselves. The only clue that something has changed is the character selection dialog.

Character region is now listed. This is because I've just launched a beta version of a sister site to Chaos Archives: [Crystal Archives](https://crystalarchives.org/).

All functionality is and will remain exactly the same, except that there are no automatically created events pulled from Chocobo Chronicles.

What's more, accounts are shared between the two sites. They are in fact backed by the same shared backend and database; the only difference is that the information returned is filtered by region, which is Europe for Chaos Archives and North America for Crystal Archives.

Like I said, the new system is still in beta stage. In particular, the logo and color scheme are temporary. You're welcome to report any bugs you find!
