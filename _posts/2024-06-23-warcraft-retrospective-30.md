Before we move on to The Frozen Throne, I should point something out: World of Warcraft was already long in development by the time the original Warcraft 3 shipped. The book *[The World of Warcraft Diary: A Journal of Computer Game Development](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/World_of_Warcraft_Diary)*, by Johnathan Staats, helped me appreciate just how far into development it was. Warcraft 3 and WoW were developed in parallel, and they piggybacked off each other's worldbuilding. This might explain, somewhat, why there are some inconsistencies between them, both factual and thematic: the Warcraft 3 story went through a number of iterations, which were costly to change by the time WoW shipped.<!--more-->

It might also explain why Warcraft 3 didn't feature the southern Eastern Kingdoms, the territory of the human kingdom of Stormwind. These zones the first ones made in WoW, and perhaps the Warcraft 3 developers wanted leave the WoW developers some breathing room instead of setting things in stone.

By the time Reign of Chaos went gold, the roster of playable races in WoW was already decided, and preliminary models made. There were in fact more of them planned, but cut for aesthetic or technical reasons. One such race we're about to see: while originally created for WoW, it was introduced in The Frozen Throne first.

TFT, riding off the phenomenal success of the base game, was made in the record time of nine months. Because of this, they cut some corners in the campaign, and only two cinematics were made, compared to Reign of Chaos, which had seven.[^cinematics] A shorter development cycle also meant that not all rough spots of the story could be ironed out.

And since the broad strokes of WoW were decided by the time TFT began development, any inconsistencies with it are on the writers. They have no excuse that the other game changed things.


## Terror of the Tides

Going into TFT straight after the original, you might be eager to have a lot of questions answered about what happened next. Questions like...

* How are Thrall and Jaina settling in in Kalimdor?
* How are the night elves recovering from the Legion invasion?
* What will be Arthas, Kel'Thuzad, and the Lich King's next moves?
* What has been happening back in Lordaeron during the invasion of Kalimdor?
* What happened to Illidan?

The new campaigns answer all these questions, and more.

Just like Starcraft finished with a protoss campaign, and then its expansion Brood War opened with a protoss campaign, here we begin the new story with the same faction that ended the previous one: the night elves.

The short descriptions of TFT campaigns are made of lies, damn lies, and half-truths. We're heading into a supposed "Sentinels Campaign", but the first half of it will be spent playing a new night elf faction called [the Watchers](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Watchers). In the "Alliance" campaign, we won't be playing the Alliance; in fact the game lacks a proper Alliance campaign. Finally, half of the "Scourge" campaign is dedicated to a budding [splinter faction](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Forsaken) of the Scourge.

What about the Horde? They're doing their own thing, not connected to the main campaign. That's what the "bonus campaign" is about, and I'll get to it later.

Continuing the proud tradition started by Ner'zhul in Beyond the Dark Portal, Illidan is the character who escaped the events of the previous game to usher in the events of this one. He has reverted somewhat from his full shadowy Metamorphosis appearance, combining his original night elf look with demonic horns and wings; a look that has now become iconic. In his mind, he's not the Betrayer; *he* was the one who was betrayed. He summons a magic storm, and deep under the sea, [serpent-like beings](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Naga) awaken and heed his call.

Thus begins the...


## Rise of the Naga

{% figure [caption:"Way to spoil the name of the new race before it's learned in-story!"] %}
![Rise of the Naga](/assets/wr/20240603221050_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Illidan has blazed his way across the forest, and I mean literally blazed, leaving flaming tracks in his wake. He's being chased by the night elf Watchers, led by our new hero: [Maiev Shadowsong](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Maiev_Shadowsong), the [Warden](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Warden). And I'm sorry, I need to gush about her for a minute because everything about her is just so *cool*.

{% figure [caption:"So the *Warden* leads the *Watchers*, who are a separate organization from the *Sentinels*. I get it, Blizzard, the English language has a lot of words for &ldquo;those who guard something&rdquo;, stop giving translators nightmares!"] %}
![Rise of the Naga](/assets/wr/20240603221110_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Her visual design is cool. Her voice is cool. Her sense of authority is cool. She continues the "harsh and unforgiving" tradition of female night elf leaders pioneered by Tyrande, but she's actually knowledgeable, inquisitive, and *mostly* competent. At the beginning of the story, Maiev is Justice personified, as the night elves understand it: uncompromising and unrelenting. It's not that she *hates* Illidan per se, but he's a very dangerous escaped criminal who needs to be recaptured.

We also get a new music theme --- perhaps *the* most iconic night elf theme of all time. In Reign of Chaos, the music themes were more subtle; in TFT, they're bolder, more noticeable, and more upbeat.

{% youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LisMNNhbUIU" %}

After shattering the gate, we come upon a ruined night elf village, with burning houses and corpses strewn everywhere. So they do have civilians and permanent settlements after all!

{% figure [caption:"Leaving these ruined pillars in the way doesn't seem very practical, though."] %}
![Rise of the Naga](/assets/wr/20240603221226_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

In TFT, each faction got a fourth hero, and we get to play that hero in that faction's campaign. As a Warden, Maiev starts with two abilities: Fan of Knives, an AoE attack that sends knives flying outwards from her position, and Blink, a short-range teleport not unlike D&D's Misty Step (though way predating it). For the first time in all of Warcraft 3, we control a hero with an innate teleportation ability, and the map designers went *wild* with the possibilities.

It's worth breaking every crate, exploring every corner, and blinking to every single patch of land that can be reached: these often contain secrets. The first such secret, only reachable by Blink, is a chain of islands populated by fish people called mur--

*Mur'gul?*

{% figure [caption:"Runes are a new type of item that restore health and/or mana when touched, and cannot be picked up. This allowed the map designers to put in more challenging encounters without fighting for inventory slots or making the player feel punished for exploring."] %}
![Rise of the Naga](/assets/wr/20240603221338_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Welcome to the first of the unexplained renames. In TFT, murlocs are not found anywhere in the new campaigns. In their place are [mur'gul](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Mur'gul), who look like more monstrous murlocs with spikes growing out of their backs instead of fins. The weird part is that it's not acknowledged by WoW, which has plenty of murlocs, but no mur'gul whatsoever.

Next is a tribe of corrupted furbolgs who cannot be saved, and whom we put out of their misery.

{% figure [caption:"Does she almost look... gleeful when saying this?"] %}
![Rise of the Naga](/assets/wr/20240603221703_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

That big huntress, by the way, is no regular huntress: her name is [Naisha](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Naisha), and she's a special unit, Maiev's first lieutenant and perhaps the closest thing she has to a [~~roommate~~](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/oh-my-god-they-were-roommates) best friend. You're not required to keep her alive, but if she dies in gameplay, the story still continues as if she survived every mission.

Soon we get our first side quest. Maiev meets the survivors of one of her scout teams, who were attacked by a berserk owlbear... sorry, *wildkin*.

{% figure [caption:"Ah, the Driven Mad Syndrome, Blizzard's number one supplier of boss encounters."] %}
![Rise of the Naga](/assets/wr/20240603222041_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Between RoC and TFT, a few unit names inexplicably changed, often alongside their models. The night elf ballista was replaced with the glaive thrower, the orc catapult with the demolisher, and the human gyrocopter and steam tank with the flying machine and [~~siege tank~~](https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Siege_tank) siege engine. And owlbears became wildkin. It's speculated that it was done for trademark reasons, and indeed gyrocopters and steam tanks might have been renamed to avoid clashes with Wildhammer Fantasy, but *ballistas and catapults?* These are generic terms!

{% figure [caption:"Ah, the Driven Mad Syndrome, Blizzard's number one supplier of boss encounters."] %}
![Rise of the Naga](/assets/wr/20240603222548_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

After killing the wildkin, we encounter the serpentine race from the cinematic, busy burning another night elf village and the ships in its harbor.

{% figure [caption:"Famous last words."] %}
![Rise of the Naga](/assets/wr/20240603222548_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Maiev counters: *"Naga? Many craven races have tempted our wrath over the centuries. None have survived!"* I sure wonder what these races were and how many accounts of genocide the night elves have committed. It's not like they're going to retcon that, right?

Next we rest at a Fountain of Health, where the army, once again, stands idle while Maiev blinks atop the waterfall, killing spiders and taking their stuff.

{% figure [caption:"I imagine that by now, the Watchers treat Maiev's many solo adventures as just the kind of thing the boss does. Roll with it."] %}
![Rise of the Naga](/assets/wr/20240603223113_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

In another side quest, we rescue night elf warriors captured by satyrs, who, curiously, allude to serving some kind of "master". Are they Illidan's followers as well? That's weird.

{% figure [caption:"I like just how blunt and straightforward Maiev is with everyone she meets."] %}
![Rise of the Naga](/assets/wr/20240603223422_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

We reach another gate, and the game is kind enough to warn us (through Maiev) that it's a point of no return. Something is brewing on the other side, where the port of [Nendis](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Nendis)[^nendis] lies.

That something turns out to be Illidan and more naga, who are burning the ships while their master ~~steals~~ [commandeers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xipgRHfgSDo) one and sails away.

{% figure [caption:"But who's crewing that ship? Naga? Captive night elves?"] %}
![Rise of the Naga](/assets/wr/20240603223550_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

It's an easy-to-miss point, but it shows Illidan had a reason, albeit a twisted one, to leave all this destruction in his wake. He wasn't slaughtering random civilians for evil's sake; he was targeting specifically coastal towns, and burning the ships docked there, to ensure he couldn't be followed by sea. Which is still evil, mind you.

We have to save at least two of the remaining ships to pursue him. Once we do, the mission ends.

{% figure [caption:"Let those that cursed my name, curse me still, and whine their way back to the cages of Elune! Let the ships burn!"] %}
![Rise of the Naga](/assets/wr/20240603223802_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Maiev dodges Naisha's question of whether they can actually defeat Illidan even if they find him, only saying that they must trust time to reveal all things. I like how everyone just [uses](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InsistentTerminology) the term "night elf" as if it's a single inseparable word, resulting in some awkward phrasing.

Heave away, cast off bow line, and set the mainsail! We're setting a course for...


## The Broken Isles

{% figure [caption:"Not pictured is an entire huge landmass populated by elves, tauren and vrykul, but it was there all along, we pinky swear."] %}
![The Broken Isles](/assets/wr/20240603223836_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Pursuing Illidan across the sea, the Watchers land on an island that doesn't appear on any of their maps. Maiev deduces that these islands must have formed only recently, even though there's no power left in the world capable of doing that. She concludes this because she recognizes the ruins.

{% figure [caption:"By the way, ignore that magical dome over there that totally exists."] %}
![The Broken Isles](/assets/wr/20240603223906_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Regardless, it is a mystery they'll have to solve later. For now, they'll establish a base. Our stated objective here is the same as before: "Find Illidan".

At the base, we have much of the night elf tech tree unlocked right away. This is the expansion; it assumes you've played the base game and know what you're doing. The kid gloves are off.

On the very same island, Maiev encounters... an orc?

{% figure [caption:"They're hiding *exposition* behind side quests now?"] %}
![The Broken Isles](/assets/wr/20240612003640_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Next to him is a goblin shipyard, introducing us to the main gimmick of this mission, which is sea exploration. Reign of Chaos had no playable ships at all; here they exist, but only as hirable neutral units, with very limited campaign presence, ensuring they don't overstay their welcome like back in Warcraft 2.

For some reason, the goblin shipyard offers night elf ships. Pondering this riddle for the ages, I level the small naga base to the west. Yes, the naga actually have their own tech tree, with worker units and everything. They were considered as a playable faction for TFT, but were eventually left as an incomplete, campaign-only faction.

{% figure [caption:"Their towers are some kind of serpent heads rising from water, which I think is neat."] %}
![The Broken Isles](/assets/wr/20240612004153_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Actually the naga were first designed for World of Warcraft, and as a playable race at that, before TFT even began development.[^naga] However, these plans never materialized because they were an animation nightmare; in particular, the animators couldn't figure out how they would wear armor and ride mounts.

On that same island, Maiev says what I consider the single most elven line in the entire game. It's great.

{% figure [caption:"Woe be our people: our woods despoiled, our immortality lost, and our units unable to be targeted inside a building or transport."] %}
![The Broken Isles](/assets/wr/20240612004623_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Maiev finally finds the ghosts Drak'thul spoke about: skeletal orcs locked into forever reliving their last battle. Destroying the three buildings that spawn them puts them to rest, and once we return to Drak'thul, he tells Maiev his story.

He was once a warlock of the Stormreaver clan. Nearly twenty years ago, Gul'dan raised these islands from the sea, looking for the remains of the Dark Titan --- whom Maiev identifies as Sargeras, the Legion's creator. 

{% figure [caption:"For your crimes, I will punish you by not looking at you."] %}
![The Broken Isles](/assets/wr/20240612005345_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Ever since Gul'dan's demise, Drak'thul wandered the isles alone, haunted by restless ghosts. Maiev now actually regrets helping him, saying he deserves far worse. Still, a reward is a reward, and we get a Robe of the Magi +6 for our efforts.

Illidan himself is found at the gate of the Tomb of Sargeras, in the northeast, but the way is blocked by a large and powerful naga base.

{% figure [caption:"Uniquely among all factions, the naga can place their buildings in shallow water."] %}
![The Broken Isles](/assets/wr/20240612005841_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Once we destroy it and get closer to Illidan, he enters the tomb while ordering his entourage to stand guard.

{% figure [caption:"Weird camera angles and objects blocking the view are a staple of TFT. I assume they ran out of time to polish the cinematography."] %}
![The Broken Isles](/assets/wr/20240612010233_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

The guards are nowhere near as difficult as the naga base was, though. Now that our own base is no longer under attack, we can sail around the entire map, find the remaining secrets, and then engage the naga guards and complete the mission. I like how on many base-building missions, the game lets the player be in control of when exactly they're ready to proceed with the campaign, letting them discover and collect everything at their leisure once the main threat is gone.

We dive after Illidan into...


## The Tomb of Sargeras

{% figure [caption:"Wait, why is the X on the opposite side of the island from the tomb itself?"] %}
![The Tomb of Sargeras](/assets/wr/20240612010720_1.jpg)

## Wrath of the Betrayer

## Unfinished Business

Next up: the expedition that WoW never acknowledged.


[^cinematics]: The game intro, the prologue and human intro cinematics, and each campaign's ending cinematic.

[^nendis]: Sindarin for "water-woman", though this is likely unintentional. And like many locations from TFT, it's nowhere to be found in WoW.

[^naga]: And in lore, they were foreshadowed all the way back in *Day of the Dragon*.
