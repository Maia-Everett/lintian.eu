And so, Illidan, Kael'thas, and Vashj are preparing to storm Icecrown Glacier and destroy the Frozen Throne, and with it, the Lich King. Of course, the Scourge is hardly going to sit idle while an enemy strikes at their leader, and we're about to find out what they've been up to since we last saw them.

## Legacy of the Damned

Curse of the Blood Elves was the shortest campaign in the game, except for the orc prologue campaign. The Scourge campaign, Legacy of the Damned, is, in contrast, the longest campaign in the game. Officially it has eight chapters, but one chapter is actually three missions in a trenchcoat, for a total of whopping ten missions. Because of the sheer length of this campaign, I intend to cover it in three posts instead of the usual two.

The reason it's so long is because it tells two largely independent stories, one setting up the undead faction in World of Warcraft[^wow], and the other wrapping up the Frozen Throne storyline. Storytelling-wise it would probably make sense to split this campaign in two, but then some players wouldn't be pleased to play two campaigns for the same faction in a row.

We leave Outland behind and return to Lordaeron, now ruled by...


## King Arthas

{% figure [caption:"I'm sure the Plaguelands are actually filled with sunshine and rainbows, and they only named them that to be ironic."] %}

The explosive ending to Reign of Chaos didn't give closure to the Scourge storyline, leaving its fate uncertain. We saw the Scourge march to Mount Hyjal under the Burning Legion's command, but Arthas, who was inexplicably in Kalimdor, helped foil the invasion. But what happened to the Scourge after that?

We're back in Lordaeron. Three differently colored dreadlords --- [Varimathras](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Varimathras) the red, [Detheroc](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/) the green[^detheroc], and [Balnazzar](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Balnazzar) the purple --- are overseeing the Scourge in Archimonde's absence.

{% figure [caption:"The vanilla undead campaign showed that dreadlords commune through the Twisting Nether to exchange news. Why didn't these three do that?"] %}
![King Arthas](/assets/wr/20240907124150_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

They haven't heard from Archimonde or received any orders in months, and they're getting worried. Unknown to them, they're being watched by Kel'Thuzad and Sylvanas, and the latter asks a very good question.

{% figure [caption:"Dear writers, raising a question in-universe only means you're aware of the narrative problem. It doesn't actually *address* it."] %}
![King Arthas](/assets/wr/20240907124212_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

How *could* they not know, indeed? Tichondrius in the previous undead campaign exchanged news with the other dreadlords. Presumably any surviving remains of Archimonde's army could have brought the news of Archimonde's demise by the same means. Actually, what happened to that army, anyway? Did all the demons just poof out of Azeroth when Archimonde was torn apart by wisps?

Mind you, that's the least of the questions I have. What intrigues me more is Sylvanas's model change. Clearly, something happened to her offscreen between the two undead campaigns, and it goes entirely unaddressed in-game.

In the vanilla undead campaign, [Arthas raised Sylvanas as a banshee](https://lintian.eu/2024/05/04/warcraft-retrospective-24/), an incorporeal ghost. Here, however, she's a [dark ranger](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Dark_ranger), a corporeal undead elf. It's not explained how or why she got a body again, whether it's her old body or someone else's, or even if it's a retcon and she was never an incorporeal banshee to begin with. The dark ranger is actually a playable neutral hero in multiplayer, so perhaps the campaign writers wanted to showcase it in this way.

Suddenly, Arthas bursts in by breaking the gate!

{% endfigure %}

The dialogue subtitles address him as "King Arthas" now, and indeed, that's how he demands to be addressed now. He tells the dreadlords that their Legion masters have been defeated. Like good Saturday morning cartoon villains, the dreadlords say "This isn't over, human!" and teleport away, even though, from their perspective, they have no reason to believe Arthas and every reason to tear him apart in a three-on-one fight.

With the dreadlords gone for now, Arthas addresses Kel'Thuzad and Sylvanas. To solidify his rule as the new, undead king of Lordaeron, he wants the scour the kingdom of the last remnants of humanity, but there's a problem: the humans have begun abandoning their villages.

{% endfigure %}

And so, it falls to Arthas, Kel'Thuzad and Sylvanas to intercept the escaping human refugees and slaughter them before they get to safety.

Thus begins the mission --- a very unique one.

We're controlling three sides: Arthas, Kel'Thuzad, and Sylvanas. Each of them guards a corner of the map where human refugees are flocking, and if we let twenty or more villagers escape, we fail the mission. We're given practically unlimited resources, but each side can only build ghouls and one more unit. For Arthas it's abominations, for Kel'Thuzad, necromancers, and for Sylvanas, banshees.

{% figure [caption:"Hold the line, my unholy brethren!"] %}
![King Arthas](/assets/wr/20240907131203_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

To eliminate the opposition, we must destroy nine refugee camps across the map. But on top of everything *else*, there's an additional complication.

Every time you attack a refugee camp, a paladin and two knights teleport in. The paladins respawn at altars at the base in the center of the map, which also blocks the way between Arthas, Kel'Thuzad, and Sylvanas's portions.

Thankfully, like many others, this mission becomes substantially easier if you know the trick.

Each of the three heroes starts with three goblin land mines. Immediately after gaining control, I took a lone Arthas on a suicide run to the central base. As he stood between the three altars, I placed all three land mines there. The resulting explosion took out all three altars at once --- at the cost of getting Arthas killed, but then I revived him at my own altar and took him and his abominations on a rampage through his section of the map. Once the paladin assigned to that corner got killed, he stayed dead. Having eliminated all three refugee camps, I then assaulted the central base and killed the remaining two paladins for good.[^paladins]

{% endfigure %}

Meanwhile, Kel'Thuzad and Sylvanas defended their passes. Kel'Thuzad is not ideal for offense, since he has the squishiest unit, but the necromancers and their skeletons are very good at holding the line, so he stayed in defense for this mission. Sylvanas, meanwhile, has been growing her forces. Her banshees possessed big, juicy units such as knights and militia captains, and she herself leveled twice, from level 2 to level 4.

Arthas and Kel'Thuzad, meanwhile, both started at level 10, but this is about to change. As soon as we raze the sixth refugee camp, a cutscene plays. Arthas is struck by crippling pain --- and we see the Lich King for the first time!

{% figure [caption:"The writers just can't make up their minds on whether the Lich King can communicate directly with Arthas or not. Now, he suddenly can. Again."] %}
![King Arthas](/assets/wr/wc3x_undead1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Unlike regular liches, who are obviously reanimated orc skeletons[^orc], the Lich King is apparently a suit of armor encased in a block of ice, with no bones in sight.

Kel'Thuzad arrives and asks if Arthas needs assistance. Arthas says that the pain has passed, but his powers have diminished. Once we regain control of him, he has been knocked down to level 9.

After Arthas destroys the three refugee camp on Sylvanas's side, Sylvanas can join him with her forces, now consisting mostly of possessed units. Together they demolish the remaining three camps on Kel'Thuzad's side.

{% figure [caption:"For the king! Er, for the Lich King! Why am I attacking fellow humans again?"] %}
![King Arthas](/assets/wr/20240907133426_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Humanity has been eradicated in Lordaeron, but Arthas has another episode of crippling pain. 

{% figure [caption:"Thanks for clarifying that it's you, Lich King. After all, it could have been an impostor who just happens to look and sound like the Lich King."] %}
![King Arthas](/assets/wr/20240907133705_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

The king will not be staying in his kingdom for long, after all. He asks Kel'Thuzad to take him back to the capital, as he has a long journey ahead of him.


## A Kingdom Divided

{% figure [caption:"But how did the dreadlords pass her the invitation? By teleporting in and out?"] %}

{% endfigure %}

The next evening, Sylvanas arrives at the dreadlords' hideout, and they're pleased that she came.

{% figure [caption:"Wait, these are Kaldorei Empire ruin assets. But they presumably stand in for Lordaeronian architecture."] %}
![A Kingdom Divided](/assets/wr/20240907133751_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

She believes the dreadlords know why, and indeed they do. They've discovered that the Lich King is losing his power, and with it, his ability to command undead. Arthas's powers will thus also fade over time, which is convenient for the dreadlords' plans to overthrow him. While Kel'Thuzad is too loyal to betray his master, they believe Sylvanas, whose people Arthas murdered and whom he raised into undeath by force, will be more easily turned against him.

However, Sylvanas rejects the proposed alliance. She will execute her vengeance in her own way. With that, she leaves. While Balnazzar doesn't trust her, believing her heart is still elven, Varimathras and Detheroc think she might still prove useful to the dreadlords' cause.


## The Flight from Lordaeron

Next up: Arthas receives a cold welcome in Northrend, and Sylvanas faces the remaining two dreadlords. But where is Kel'Thuzad?


[^wow]: The development of World of Warcraft was long underway by the time TFT development started, and [its undead faction](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Forsaken) was there pretty much from the start.

[^detheroc]: As an aside, while he's a normal dreadlord in classic TFT, Reforged for some reason gave Detheroc a [fat model](https://constantinuslupus.artstation.com/projects/28ZOnv). No, I don't know why.

[^paladins]: Incidentally, one of the three paladins is [Magroth the Defender](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Magroth_the_Defender), the same one we rescued from naga captivity in the night elf campaign. Continuity!

[^orc]: Specifically, they were made from Ner'zhul's orc followers.
