But the moment she killed the paladin who kept the two races working together despite their tensions, the Burning Legion launched an invasion into night elf lands. And the Sentinel Army, badass warrior women with ten thousand years of training and strategizing, whose very *raison d'Ãªtre* was to prepare for the inevitable return of the Legion, had no viable answer other than retreat.

> Brave Tyrande ran away.  
> Bravely ran away, away!  
> When Burning Legion reared its head,  
> She bravely turned her tail and fled.  
> Yes, brave Tyrande turned about  
> And gallantly she chickened out.  
> Bravely taking to her feet,  
> She beat a very brave retreat,  
> Bravest of the brave, Tyrande!

Okay, I'm not being *entirely* fair here. For one, Cenarius, who could go one on one against the strongest demon lords, is dead, and lack of his support crippled the Sentinels. Of course, Even granting that, the Sentinels lost to a single orc clan without Cenarius, and even though he easily gave them a beating once he appeared on the battlefield himself, he fell to the same orcs gorged on demon blood --- not even to full demons. I'm not sure he'd have made *that* much of a difference, had he survived.

And without Cenarius, Tyrande's crowning solo achievement so far was killing a reasonable authority figure who likely would have just left her alone or even allied with the night elves, had she asked nicely. Her rashness and prejudice *are*, after all, very much intended character flaws.

Now that Furion has awakened, though, the night elves' fortunes will begin to turn. He will now lead a quest to awaken the other druids, but before we get to that, let's review...


## The Invasion Stratagems of the Burning Legion

The Burning Legion is a refreshing change from the usual evil legions of doom seen in stock fantasy, in that they're *smart*.

As GiantCrabGames mentions in his ["Warcraft 3: Campaign Masterpiece or Overrated?"](https://youtu.be/UvS0mArxpyo?t=10138) video, the Burning Legion has destroyed countless worlds prior to this one, and they have their invasions figured out down to a science, letting the inhabitants of the world do most of the work for them without needlessly wasting their own forces. Their strategy involves three steps.

1. Find promising individuals whom they can seduce with dreams of power. On Draenor, that was Gul'dan; in Lordaeron, Kel'Thuzad and Arthas; and in Kalimdor, Grom Hellscream.
2. Use their chosen proxies to sow chaos among the defenders of the world who could otherwise oppose a full-scale Legion invasion. By this point, at least four of the kingdoms of the Alliance (Lordaeron, Dalaran, Alterac, and Quel'Thalas) are in ruins, and the rest are still recovering from the Second War.
3. Use the generated chaos to eliminate important individuals who could organize a successful resistance, such as King Terenas, Archmage Antonidas, and Cenarius.

The Legion has had setbacks, but mostly, so far, we've only had some successes against their proxies, and whenever the demons themselves appear on screen, they generally succeed at their goals. This helps preserve them as a viable and menacing threat until the final confrontation.

And against a foe that saps the defenders' strength by pitting the nations of the world against each other, the only way to have even a *chance* of repelling them is to unite everyone, *literally everyone*, and hope no one will stab you in the back.


## The Druids Arise

Two days after Furion awakened, he finally decides to tell her how he felt in the thousand years since they were separated.

{% figure [caption:"I swear, those animated portraits. Furion looks like he's suffering from constipation."] %}

{% endfigure %}

Turns out the two are lovers. Furion finally reveals what the Legion's final goal is:

{% figure [caption:"What if you destroyed the World Tree first? Sure, it would diminish you, but at least Archimonde can't destroy the world, right?"] %}
![The Druids Arise](/assets/wr/20240520211557_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Right now, the immediate plan is to reach the barrow dens at the end of the valley and awaken the druids of the talon, who will be valuable allies against the demons. They come upon humans fighting undead, and Furion thinks they might be powerful allies too, but Tyrande shuts him down.

{% figure [caption:"Night elf culture has a concept of damnation?"] %}

{% endfigure %}

"Perhaps you are right, my love," says Furion, and that's the end of that, for now. The mission begins, and... all our tree buildings are uprooted?

{% figure [caption:"We go, we go, we go to war, to hew the stone and break the door!"] %}

{% endfigure %}

Welcome to one of the longest missions in the game! And it's great.

This is like one of those Starcraft 2 missions where Raynor will ask "What's the catch?" and someone will explain the gimmick mechanic that the entire mission is built around, except nobody *explains* it here --- you *discover* it on your own. The catch here is that all the gold mines in this mission contain very little gold, so we have to take advantage of our ability to constantly relocate our base from mine to mine, harvesting what we can before moving on.

We get Furion as our second hero. Gameplay-wise, he is a [Keeper of the Grove](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Keeper_of_the_Grove_(Warcraft_III)). At this point, his active abilities are Entangling Roots, which temporarily traps an enemy unit in place, and Force of Nature, which animates nearby trees into treants to fight for us.[^treants] Like Thrall's wolves, treants are perfect as disposable frontliners and scouts. (Admittedly it's a bit ironic that the night elf faction has so many ways to destroy trees.)

One of Furion's item slots is permanently occupied by the Horn of Cenarius. Like the Urn of King Terenas in the undead campaign, it's a plot item and cannot be dropped. Unlike the undead campaign, however, someone got the memo that simply carrying an item useless in gameplay was unsatisfying, so the Horn is actually a pretty useful item, giving Furion hefty bonuses to HP maximum and HP regeneration.

We root our trees at the first mine just ahead, put the wisps to gather gold, and go out exploring--

> Our sacred grove is being desecrated!

Oops, did I mention that you're traveling in the middle of *total chaos?*

{% figure [caption:"We help the weaker side, of course, before slaughtering them as well."] %}
![The Druids Arise](/assets/wr/20240520212740_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

The orcs and undead are having skirmishes over the map, and you get periodically caught in the crossfire. I strategically placed my ancient protector and an extra wisp to repair them, making sure that my army won't have to come back to defend the base. Too often, anyway.

Soon, Tyrande and Furion come across a defiled fountain of life.

{% figure [caption:"This entire furbolg tribe must be purged! Also, we're the good guys."] %}
![The Druids Arise](/assets/wr/20240520212820_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Turns out the furbolgs who fled back in the first mission didn't escape corruption after all. Instead of even discussion the possibility of finding a cure, Tyrande immediately jumps to the conclusion that they must be eradicated, and since the writers have apparently forgot that this is supposed to immediately paint the character as evil, we merrily go ahead, slaughtering the entire tribe for a side quest.

{% figure [caption:"Look, you woke him up to help you. Is it really the best time to be throwing potshots like this?"] %}
![The Druids Arise](/assets/wr/20240520213432_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

We're seeing an interesting reversal of the usual gender dynamic in fantasy. Furion, the man, is the calm and diplomatic one, more willing to work together with others, and Tyrande, the woman, is the aggressive and bloodthirsty one, constantly talking about her plans to kill someone --- while constantly shutting down Furion whenever he tries to speak against her. If the genders were switched, we'd already be crying foul. This story suggests --- if what we're seeing here is the norm --- that night elf society might have gender dynamics just as skewered as many historical human societies, but in the other direction, which might be interesting to explore in depth--

> Our sacred grove is being desecrated!

Sigh.

Eventually we come across a human base behind a gate. Of course, instead of trying to parley or anything, we just attack, raze it, and move our trees in its place.

{% figure [caption:"Distract their disposable troops with our disposable troops!"] %}
![The Druids Arise](/assets/wr/20240520214053_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Next is a cursed forest populated by undead --- not Scourge undead, but ye olde D&D-style undead. Skeletons are little more than a nuisance, but the woods are also filled with ghosts, who can possess your units like banshees do. On a map with limited gold, this stings. One way to counter it is to use just the heroes, who can't be possessed, and dryads, who are immune to magic.

{% figure [caption:"I've seen the truth! Tyrande will lead us to ruin! Wake up, sheeple!"] %}
![The Druids Arise](/assets/wr/20240520214521_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

We get another side quest to kill the Death Revenant responsible for the curse, which restores the land, kills all the undead, and even cleanses the blighted trees.[^trees] Some players actually prefer not to complete this quest, since the undead are a source of infinite gold in an otherwise gold-starved mission.

Past the cursed glade lies the night elf outpost that's supposed to be defending the barrow dens... but something's not quite right.

{% figure [caption:"Their garish choice of colors has no place in this world! Elune has decreed that they be exterminated in the name of good taste!"] %}
![The Druids Arise](/assets/wr/20240520215200_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

This base has been taken over by satyrs, and we need to destroy it to get to the barrow dens.

Here we see Warcraft 3's twist on the concept of the mirror match. In Warcraft 1, 2, and Beyond the Dark Portal, each campaign had an obligatory mission where you fought your own faction. (Beyond the Dark Portal couldn't shoehorn a human vs. human plot into the human campaign, so it has an orc vs. orc mission instead). In Warcraft 3, where each faction actually has gameplay mechanics very different from all others, straight mirror matches would be boring, so mission designers spice things up somewhat. We've already played regular orcs (plus their troll, tauren, and wyvern allies) against chaos orcs. Now we're playing night elves against corrupted night elves. And yes, Furion identifies them as such.

{% figure [caption:"I'm especially disappointed in you, treant. You used to call yourself a night elf!"] %}
![The Druids Arise](/assets/wr/20240520215215_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

This revelation might feel like a random lore drop, but I think it actually serves a greater purpose: characterizing Furion. Throughout this campaign, he comments on things he encounters from the perspective of someone who's *been there and seen things*, not unlike Gandalf. It helps sell the idea that he's *ancient*, he's knowledgeable about more things than we see, and in particular, he knows his enemies --- and their weaknesses.

And with his knowledge, he might just find a way to beat an enemy that cannot be beaten through conventional force of arms.

Past the satyr base lie the barrow dens. Furion sounds the horn, and the druids of the talon awaken. Next are the druids of the claw.

{% figure [caption:"They can turn into crows. I know! Maybe the Prophet is one of them?"] %}
![The Druids Arise](/assets/wr/20240520215953_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

This mission is a perfect example of why I love Warcraft 3 so much. It is absolutely crammed with stuff to discover, and is essentially several adventures packed into one. We crossed a war zone, caught in the crossfire of flyers fighting overhead; killed a whole tribe of crazed furbolgs; stormed a human base; cleansed a cursed glade populated by undead; and finally, plowed our own corrupted ancients out of their misery. The druids of the talon are really an arbitrary MacGuffin here; anything could be behind this gauntlet of obstacles. Gameplay-wise it's a blast, and there's so much stuff to try that every playthrough is going to be different.

And so, in his overconfidence, Archimonde walks straight into Furion's trap.

Remember how, in the [previous post](https://lintian.eu/2024/05/24/warcraft-retrospective-27/), I mentioned that wisps can detonate themselves to damage summoned creatures?

Furion gathered a *staggering* number of wisps around the World Tree.

And Archimonde is a summoned creature.

*Hasta la vista, baby.*

Next up, we're going to take a break from playing Warcraft 3 for a deeper dive into the strengths of its worldbuilding --- and the high bar it set for the rest of the franchise, which successor games, sadly, often fail to meet.

Our sacred grove is being desecrated!


[^treants]: Unlike necromancer skeletons, there's numerical consistency here as well: you'll never get more treants than there are trees around. If you point the spell at a cluster of one or two trees, you'll get one or two treants, not all three or four.

[^trees]: Technically, since the Warcraft 3 engine doesn't allow cleansing blighted trees, the script destroys them and grows new ones in their place.
