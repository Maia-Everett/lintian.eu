Before we leave Sylvanas behind, let me say just one thing.

Sometimes you hear accusations that Blizzard "ruined" Sylvanas by "turning" her into a villain in later WoW. I don't think that's fair to say, since portraying her as a villain is entirely consistent with her portrayal in The Frozen Throne.

She's evil! She tortures her victim instead of giving him a clean death, she mind controls masses of unwilling people into blind obedience, she lies to Garithos and enters an agreement that she has no intention of honoring, and finally, she orders Garithos killed, unprovoked. The problem is that the campaign is set up so that none of her evil actions (other than mind control) are directed at innocent people; [her victims are villains themselves](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AssholeVictim), namely the dreadlords (who may have committed more evil than her), Arthas (who has *definitely* committed more evil than her), and Garithos (not only evil, considering his readiness to execute all the innocent blood elves, but a massive jerkass to boot). The end result is that when Sylvanas wins, we root for her, even when we recognize deep down that her actions are monstrous.

We'll see later how this changes in World of Warcraft.

For now we're returning to Arthas and Anub'arak. Leaving the shores of Northrend behind, they're ready to descend...<!--more-->

## Overall Thoughts

Legacy of the Damned is a campaign about evil versus evil (and versus evil). It focuses on two villain protagonists who both achieve their goal and do a lot of harm in the process. Whereas the original Warcraft 3 had a [bittersweet ending](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BittersweetEnding) (the Legion invasion was stopped, but at a great cost), The Frozen Throne has an outright [downer ending](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DownerEnding) Bad things happen to good people, the Lich King's opposition is soundly beaten, and the Lich King himself, in Arthas's body, is now stronger than ever. Whether his Arthas or Ner'zhul, his renewed reign is going to bide ill for Azeroth.

Narratively, The Frozen Throne is set up as a conflict between Illidan and Arthas. Both of them were very popular characters when Warcraft 3 was released, and their popularity hasn't faded even now, twenty-two years later --- which means that the Blizzard of old did something right when setting them up. I think it helps that they're both villains with cool designs, expressive personalities, and proactivity, taking matters into their hands and paving the way for their victories instead of [sitting on their thrones](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/OrcusOnHisThrone) waiting to be defeated.

The two are foils to each other, not just because they have diametrically opposed goals (destroying the Frozen Throne versus saving it), but also because they represent different approach

Both characters enjoyed breakout popularity, but of course, they didn't start with it. We didn't come to Warcraft 3 for Arthas and Illidan; we didn't know they existed, so we came to Warcraft 3 for the compelling story and fun gameplay, and *stayed* for Arthas and Illidan (and Uther, and Jaina, and Thrall, and Kael'thas, and Sylvanas...). In the time of Classic Blizzard, interesting characters were a bonus on top of everything else, stepping out of their stories and into enduring popularity, rather than a marketing gimmick to lure players in and then be discarded.


## Next Up

This is it for the main storyline of the Frozen Throne, consisting of the night elf, blood elf, and undead campaigns and concerning the race between Arthas and Illidan for the titular Frozen Throne.

However, the expansion still has one story left to tell. The Horde has a side campaign of its own, completely unrelated to the main plot and instead focusing on the orcs settling in Kalimdor, and the challenges they face as they carve a piece of land for themselves.

Prepare for The Founding of Durotar, a campaign unlike any other --- one that plays less like an RTS and more like a mini-RPG!
