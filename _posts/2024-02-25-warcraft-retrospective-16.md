Today we're looking at *[The Last Guardian](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/The_Last_Guardian)* by [Jeff Grubb](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Jeff_Grubb)[^jeff_grubb], the last of the four novels meant to set up the stage for Warcraft 3.

There seems to have been some confusion about the book's publication date, with some sources (like Amazon and Goodreads) saying it was December 2001, and others (including Warcraft Wiki and Google Books) claiming it was December 2002. The latter would mean it was released after Warcraft 3. However, as we'll see, it was very clearly written *before* the lore of Warcraft 3 was finalized, and [ISBN Search](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/0671041517) seems to agree with the 2001 date. It also seems fitting to go through all four books at once before we continue with the games.

Unlike the previous three books, this one doesn't tell a completely new story. Instead, it fleshes out events we already know about in broad strokes, specifically Medivh's backstory (as told in the Warcraft 2 manual) and his demise during Warcraft 1. It also gives a thought-out backstory to Khadgar, telling about his humble origins as Medivh's apprentice before he rose to be one of the heroes of Beyond the Dark Portal. *The Last Guardian* does technically retcon Khadgar into the events of Warcraft 1[^khadgar], but that game's storytelling was so basic that I think it's best to just regard it as the full version of events we only knew about in a short summary before.

Let's dive into...

## Final Thoughts


### The Prose

This book has a really slow start. Like I said, it takes many description-laden pages for Khadgar to even meet Medivh. The prose is purplish at times and had me reach for the dictionary in the intro pages for a few times, but unlike *Day of the Dragon*, it doesn't feel grating or showing off. Unlike some *other* Warcraft writers, Jeff Grubb knows what language is appropriate for what situation, and when it makes sense to use obscure words and long-winded descriptions and when it doesn't.

Luckily, from the trip to Stormwind onwards, the pacing picks up, and the tension gradually builds up and leads to a satisfying climax. Overall it was an enjoyable read.

If I were to complain about something, it would be the needless use of scientific terminology. Even if the characters are aware in-universe that atoms and cells exist, talking about them doesn't really fit the pseudo-medieval fantasy feel that Warcraft is going for this far. Now if this was World of Warcraft and it was gnomes talking about these things, then by all means, it would perfectly fit their technobabble and further establish them as outliers in their world.


### The Plot

<figure class="character-portrait">
<img src="/assets/wr/wc1_manual_medivh.png" width="300" /><figcaption>Medivh in the Warcraft 1 manual. To my knowledge, this was the only art of him before Warcraft 3. Yeah.</figcaption></figure>

In Warcraft 1, Medivh was a generic evil wizard who summoned the orcs to Azeroth either deliberately or by accident, depending on which piece of text you believe, and was killed while summoning daemons in his yet-unnamed tower by generic Stormwind soldiers.

In Warcraft 2, his backstory was expanded, and he became more sympathetic. His malice was now attributed to his corruption by the Twisting Nether during the years he spent in a coma. But it was not until this book that we learned the full story. We saw that Medivh never really got the chance to be himself. He had an identity crisis between the noble Guardian who inherited Aegwynn's cosmic power, the spirit of Sargeras possessing his body, and the part of him that just wanted to live a simple life, held hostage by the other two.

Now that he's back, and seemingly free from Sargeras's taint, he might finally get that wish. We'll see. The writers no doubt have long-term plans for Medivh that will see him become an active player in the world's affairs for many installments from now![^not]

The timeline has *greatly* expanded. In Warcraft 1 and 2, and even most of the time in the previous three books, the timeline went, as best, a few decades into the past, with the history of the human kingdoms a complete unknown, though *Day of the Dragon* offhandedly mentioned a great offscreen ancient war where Deathwing betrayed the other Dragon Aspects by creating the Demon Soul. Now, we're getting our first glimpse of what the *rest* of the world was like ten thousand years ago. However, since the backstory given in *The Last Guardian* is going to be immediately contradicted by Warcraft 3, I won't focus on it until we get to the relevant parts of the Warcraft 3 manual, most probably two entries from now.

To me, the unexpected highlight of this novel was Garona's characterization. In Warcraft 1, she was just an unusually literate scout and assassin of the Shadow Council. Here, she's sympathetic, snarky, sharp-witted, a quick thinker, and able to see things from another's perspective. She's neither a generic monstrous orc nor a generic noble-savage orc, but a very distinct individual who has lived among different cultures and knows how they think. Through her, we see some of the roots of xenophobia not just in Warcraft, but in the real world as well: when faced with an outsiders, people tend to overdwell on the differences, while overlooking the similarities.

...But what race *is* her other half, anyway?


### The Changing Role of Warcraft Books

We have now gone through four novels in a row. It's time to draw some conclusions.

It's clear that the tone is all over the place. *Day of the Dragon* is probably the outlier here, as it's focused on the action while the other three books seem more interested in the psychology of the characters. The genres are all over the place, from a small-scale ethical parable about relative nobodies, to a novelized action movie, to a [coming of age story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bildungsroman), to a relatively slow-paced story of bonding and mystery. Nonetheless, the continuity is pretty tight, there are only a few relatively minor contradictions with prior lore, and all four books introduce *troves* of new material that makes this world feel far more alive and multifaceted than one could imagine from the first two games alone.

And they turn the generic fantasy tropes on their head, giving us the first taste of the Warcraft setting's emerging unique flavor. Warcraft now has its own distinct flavor of orcs, which is as thematically different from the classic archetype as Terry Pratchett's elves are from Tolkien's. Dragons are not just fire-breathing beasts; they have a culture of their own and sometimes meddle in the affairs of mortals in disguise, with Knaak bringing some of the more original elements of the [Dragonlance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonlance) setting into this emerging new one. And demons... we don't see the whole picture yet, but they seem to be intricately-tied to the world's yet-mysterious past and its overall cosmology.

In the heyday of Warcraft, the books were there to give depth to the world and the characters. They were a bonus, letting you appreciate the worldbuilding, character motivations, and the challenges they faced. They gave us readers a sense of what was common and what was rare, what was well-known and what was mere hearsay, what was possible and what, as far as we knew, wasn't. They contained mountains of lore that remains relevant even today. This is particularly true of *The Last Guardian*, which gave us juicy details about arcane magic in ways that few other installments didn't, and that are still used by mage roleplayers as late as Dragonflight.

In the twilight years of Warcraft, the books have instead become, at best, unoriginal descriptions of [sights we already see in-game](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Exploring_Azeroth), and at worst, the places where the writers stuff all their retcons and excuses and where stated character motivations and even internal monologue are blatantly overwritten by WoW two patches later.


## And Next Up Is...

![WC3 Manual Cover](/assets/wr/wc3_manual_cover.jpg)

*At long last*, we've got to Warcraft 3. I'll start with the manual, which I'll likely have to cover in two posts due to the sheer scope of new material.

Buckle up. There's a lot to unpack.


[^jeff_grubb]: Who, surprisingly, didn't write any other Warcraft books other than co-writing the decanonized RPG.

[^khadgar]: The Beyond the Dark Portal manual said Khadgar was a hero to the Kingdom of Azeroth during the First War, but didn't elaborate further.

[^not]: Not.
