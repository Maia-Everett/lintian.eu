Before we proceed to the second half of the Terror of the Tides campaign, I should mention that Illidan gives me heavy [Fëanor](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/F%C3%ABanor) vibes.

One of the most skilled elves ever, whose pride and arrogance led to his downfall; thinking he alone could save the world, even if it's to be accomplished through mass murder, betrayal, and by defying the will of everyone else, even the gods, because clearly *they* don't have what it takes and don't know what they're doing. In fact, to hell with them and their "help"; they'd only be a burden. In fact, let's not share one's plans with anyone else and burn the ships to ensure nobody can follow.

And of course, both Fëanor and Illidan have massive fandoms insisting they have done nothing wrong.

## Thoughts on the Campaign

Terror of the Tides is an awesome campaign --- in fact, easily my favorite campaign in TFT, and one of my favorites in all of Warcraft 3.

It's full of surprises and twists, characters making decisions that seem unexpected yet are entirely in alignment with their personalities and prior actions. The gameplay is varied, ranging from wilderness exploration to base sieges to dungeon crawls to escort missions. And story-wise, it shows that night elves, despite their reclusiveness, can be effective explorers when it comes to that, help others on their way through foreign lands, and make a meaningful difference.

My only complaint is not about this campaign itself; it's about World of Warcraft. What bothers me is that not even a trace of this expedition is left in WoW. It's like the night elves never visited Silverpine Forest.[^nelfposting] It's not shown or even mentioned there. There are no camp remains, no expedition members left behind, not even letters or small keepsakes. Their role in saving Kael and retaking Dalaran is never mentioned either. In fact, and I hope to get to that, Dalaran spent the entirety of vanilla and The Burning Crusade under an impenetrable dome, with nary a mention of what was going on there.

I do realize that WoW was developed in parallel with TFT, and TFT likely brought lore that the WoW developers had no time to incorporate. But this just underscores the point I intend to make later, when I get to WoW: I think including all of Kalimdor and all of the Eastern Kingdoms in the vanilla game was a mistake, and northern Eastern Kingdoms should have been their own expansion to give them the justice they deserved.

Next up: racism is bad, mmkay?
