As we focused on Thrall and Grom Hellscream, the Burning Legion and their sinister plans sort of fell by the wayside. This is about to change.

## The Blood of Mannoroth

{% figure [caption:"Wait, wait, wait. [Moonglade](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Moonglade) is way to the north. It's nowhere near the Barrens."] %}

{% endfigure %}

All is well in the Ashenvale forest (the part that Grom isn't currently deforesting, anyway). Furbolgs are hanging out around a magic well.

{% figure [caption:"It's a beautiful life, oh, o-o-oh!"] %}
![The Blood of Mannoroth](/assets/wr/20240508235641_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Suddenly, that peace is interrupted when Mannoroth and Tichondrius teleport in.

{% endfigure %}

On Archimonde's orders, they're plotting to kill the demigod [Cenarius](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Cenarius) before the Legion begins its invasion of Kalimdor. Mannoroth fought Cenarius before and would welcome another chance to meet him in battle, but he's crafty and rarely appears in the open.

Tichondrius suggests a plan. By despoiling Ashenvale, the orcs have incurred Cenarius's wrath and will soon face him. As they are, they stand little chance against him, but Tichondrius believes Mannoroth's blood can even the odds. As he once bound the orcs in a blood pact, so can his blood reinvigorate their demonic frenzy, making them unstoppable.

Mannoroth approves of the plan. He approaches the well and spills his blood into it, which gives it an ominous red glow.

{% endfigure %}

So now, seamlessly, another piece of the puzzle is revealed. When Gul'dan enslaved the orcs to the Burning Legion prior to Warcraft 1, it was the blood of Mannoroth that bound them and turned them into bloodthirsty monsters. This shows, once again, that the way the orcs acted in Warcraft 1 and 2 was not their natural state, but a corruption.

Now the demons only have to wait --- and let Grom be himself.


## The Hunter of Shadows

{% figure [caption:"Not to be confused with a [shadow hunter](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Shadow_hunter)."] %}
![The Hunter of Shadows](/assets/wr/20240508235908_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

The unsuspecting Warsong orcs continue to turn the Ashenvale forest into the Ashenvale grassland. As Tichondrius correctly predicted, this attracts the attention of Cenarius, who turns out to be some kind of giant... night elf centaur?

{% figure [caption:"You see, the name &ldquo;Cenarius&rdquo; is a mangling of &ldquo;centaur&rdquo;. Blizzard is so clever!"] %}
![The Hunter of Shadows](/assets/wr/20240508235929_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Seriously, what is it with Warcraft 3 and centauroids? We have already seen plain old centaurs, as well as Mannoroth, half-elf-half-deer [dryads](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Dryad) among night elf forces in the previous mission, and now Cenarius. Dryads are actually called Cenarius's daughters in the manual, which also claims that centaurs are *supposedly* his bastard children, but that's only a legend and is not known for sure.

Cenarius immediately establishes what a serious threat he is by animating the trees to attack the peons.

{% figure [caption:"Technically, forests are already alive, but he's not wrong."] %}
![The Hunter of Shadows](/assets/wr/20240508235946_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

This mission is one of those that look scarier than they really are when you're playing them for the first time. To underscore just how screwed you appear to be, you're not given any quests right away. You start with four bases, but the two on the west are immediately attacked by an overwhelming night elf force and cannot be saved --- all you can do is evacuate peons from them to your main base across the river in the east. Once the night elves finish leveling your buildings, they move in their own; they can do that because most of their buildings are animate trees that can uproot and walk.

Once your three bases in the west are done with, Cenarius channels a spell that regrows the forest around all three bases.

{% figure [caption:"The animation is kind of silly, since it looks like the trees just erupt from the ground instead of growing."] %}
![The Hunter of Shadows](/assets/wr/20240515224556_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Wow. Just *wow*. If he can just casually do that, he really does deserve his title of demigod. We're so screwed. He's going to flatten us.

After this cutscene, the night elves launch an absolutely *massive* attack on the remaining base, from three directions. I actually had to restart this mission because I lost too many units and buildings to their flying units. In the second playthrough, I built mostly headhunters and raiders, and researched Ensnare to counter the chimaeras and hippogryph riders.

{% figure [caption:"Sadly, I didn't take screenshots of the full wave."] %}
![The Hunter of Shadows](/assets/wr/20240515224646_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

On this screenshot, you can notice a bug that I was hit with, and which complicated this mission a bit[^bug]. Grom lost the ability to carry items at the beginning of the mission, dropping them all at the base. This bug wasn't there at release and was apparently introduced in patch 1.31, and also occurs twice in the night elf campaign, so I'll likely have to downgrade to 1.30 for at least those two missions.

Thankfully, once the initial attack is repelled, the night elves only attack from one direction at a time, and towers are mostly sufficient to defend the base. I still have to keep around some units to take care of catapults, which attack towers from outside their range.

Soon enough, we get our quest. A witch doctor reports that he senses a dark power emanating from the wilderness --- from across the entire map, apparently --- and that it might be key to destroying Cenarius. Grom and his troops set out north, battling furbolgs, skeletons, and finally... these guys.

{% figure [caption:"Wait, but Tichondrius and Mannoroth *want* the orcs to drink from this well. Is this another trick on their part, to make it look like Grom is defying the Legion's will?"] %}
![The Hunter of Shadows](/assets/wr/20240515231316_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

These are [satyrs](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Satyr). I like them because they showcase one of the key ways in which Warcraft differs from generic fantasy settings and makes itself memorable: it takes classic creatures from mythology and fantasy, and completely reimagines them. In D&D, [satyrs](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Satyr) are fey beings associated with revelry and debauchery, looking roughly like their [prototypes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyr) in Greek mythology. These satyrs are actually demons wielding infernal magic, servants of the Burning Legion, and there is absolutely nothing merry or adorable about them.[^faun]

It actually goes further than that. Look closely at the speaking satyr's portrait. You guessed right --- they're corrupted night elves.[^satyr] They're not just random monsters for Grom to fight, they're thematically appropriate here, as a cautionary tale of what awaits the orcs should they once again turn to demonic power. Eventually they'll lose their very identity and become little more than pawns for the Legion.

The Chaos Well is secured, but the witch doctor is having second thoughts, as he senses a demonic curse in the fountain. Grom says he's "cursed already". One of the orcs offers him one last chance to turn back.

{% figure [caption:"Imagine how mad Thrall will be when he finds out!"] %}
![The Hunter of Shadows](/assets/wr/20240515231402_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Grom doesn't listen, and drinks from the fountain. This marks the second character in Warcraft 3 to voluntarily embrace corruption. There seems to be a theme going forward: both Arthas and Grom accept a curse in the name of defeating a seemingly invincible enemy, and both are thus bound in servitude to a greater power.

Drinking from the Chaos Well turns Grom a menacing shade of red[^items], and he invites the rest of his orcs to drink from it. They become red-skinned [chaos orcs](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Fel_orc)[^fel_orcs] and now deal Chaos damage, allowing them to mow down enemy units and buildings alike. Now, the night elves don't stand a chance.

{% figure [caption:"Moonhunters? Do they hunt the moon?"] %}
![The Hunter of Shadows](/assets/wr/20240515231946_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Once we deal enough damage to one of the bases, Cenarius appears. He's a very beefed-up Keeper of the Grove hero with 4000 HP, capable of immobilizing units with Entangling Roots and Cyclone and animating treants from nearby trees. He also has Divine armor, which reduces all non-Chaos attacks against him to a negligible amount. Against a full force of chaos orcs, led by a blademaster with critical strikes and Whirlwind, he doesn't stand a chance.

{% figure [caption:"I am Cenarius. My faction is also Cenarius."] %}
![The Hunter of Shadows](/assets/wr/20240515232154_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

The demigod falls... but Grom gets an unexpected visitor.

{% figure [caption:"This is the first time in the entire franchise that Grom is called Grommash."] %}
![The Hunter of Shadows](/assets/wr/20240515232213_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Mannoroth has come to bring the orcs back into the fold and make them serve the Legion once again --- and despite Grom's defiance, he finds himself powerless to resist.



## Where Wyverns Dare

{% figure [caption:"In Reforged, this mission is called &ldquo;Where Wind Riders Dare&rdquo;. This is because wyverns were renamed to wind riders in the expansion, and Reforged uses expansion units even for the Reign of Chaos campaign."] %}
![Where Wyverns Dare](/assets/wr/20240515232510_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Meanwhile, at the footsteps of Stonetalon Peak (though the location shown on the loading screen map is nowhere near), a lone goblin zeppelin is scouting the area, maneuvering between two human bases and actually taking some damage.[^damage]

{% figure [caption:"Mission control, I'm seeing gryphons at nine o'clock and towers at three o'clock, over."] %}
![Where Wyverns Dare](/assets/wr/20240515232524_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Back at the orc base, the scout, a raider, reports to Thrall that the humans have covered the entire way to the summit with their fortifications. Suddenly, Cairne walks in with two tauren.

{% figure [caption:"Hey, racial slurs! Not cool!"] %}
![Where Wyverns Dare](/assets/wr/20240515232624_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Thrall explains that these "pinkskins" are called humans, are their enemies from across the sea, and seem intent on keeping the orcs from the peak. Cairne thinks the Oracle's wisdom belongs to all, and suggests getting help from nearby [wyverns](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Wyvern), which have no love for hostile invaders.

This is a more relaxed and less hectic mission than the previous one. We only have a single chokepoint to defend, and we get a second hero: Cairne, the [tauren chieftain](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Tauren_Chieftain_(Warcraft_III)). He can stomp the ground for AoE damage and stun and send waves of earth tremor that travel in a straight line. His Endurance Aura gives bonuses to movement speed and attack speed to nearby units. Finally his ultimate ability is Reincarnation, which makes him come back to life five seconds after death, with a four-minute cooldown.

We also unlock the [tauren](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Tauren_(Warcraft_III)) unit. Each of the four playable factions has a late-game heavy melee unit: humans have knights, undead have abominations, orcs have tauren, and night elves have... a unit we haven't yet seen for story reasons, but will.

There are two side quests here. One is to restore a defiled fountain of health with a special item that drops off the centaur khan; we've had a similar quest before in the prologue campaign.

{% figure [caption:"A fountain of health in *the Barrens* was blessed by Elune? Hmm. I sure wonder if her influence once extended beyond night elf lands."] %}
![Where Wyverns Dare](/assets/wr/20240515232822_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

The other is to free the wyverns, which have been enslaved by local harpies. While optional, the wyverns will prove useful in the assault on the human base inaccessible by land.

{% figure [caption:"As will this loot!"] %}
![Where Wyverns Dare](/assets/wr/20240515234547_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

The choice of name here is, admittedly, kind of odd. In most mythology and fantasy depictions, [wyverns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyvern) are a type of dragon, and the kind of creatures introduced in Warcraft 3 --- lions with scorpion tails and sometimes with bat wings --- are more commonly called [manticores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manticore). In fact, Warcraft wyverns look pretty similar to the [depiction of manticores in D&D](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Manticore), though with leaner torsos and bigger wings.

Whatever they're called, they prove very handy in completing the main quest --- destroying the blue human base blocking the entrance to the Oracle cavern. There's also a light blue base accessible by ground, which doesn't pose any problems when assaulting it. The blue one, however, is located on a cliff and inaccessible by air, and the potential landing sites are protected with patrolling gryphon riders. Wyverns help take care of them.

{% figure [caption:"By the end, my air-dropped army was reduced to just Thrall, Cairne, and a lone tauren. And Thrall's wolves."] %}
![Where Wyverns Dare](/assets/wr/20240516000515_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Just before entering the cavern, Thrall and Cairne see Jaina enter, in the company of two knights. The entrance is surrounded by... a Stonehenge-like structure?

{% figure [caption:"Grom didn't actually say she was a sorceress. On screen, at least."] %}
![Where Wyverns Dare](/assets/wr/20240516000542_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Thrall isn't too worried. He was raised by humans, and believes he knows all their stratagems. There's no way they're going to stop him from reaching...


## The Oracle

{% figure [caption:"I sure hope that if they ever make an MMO in this world, the caverns of Stonetalon Peak will be a dungeon in it."] %}
![The Oracle](/assets/wr/20240516000827_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}


## By Demons Be Driven

{% figure [caption:"And by fire be purged!"] %}

Next up: the night elf campaign, the climactic finale of Reign of Chaos!


[^bug]: I couldn't even pick up scrolls of healing to heal my units.

[^faun]: When Shadowlands, much later, introduces [more "classic" satyr-like beings](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Sylvar), it will be a sign that they've given up on this kind of creative reimanining and are just copying D&D wholesale, from the cosmology to the creatures.

[^satyr]: This is revealed in-game in the night elf campaign, but it's also in the manual, so I might as well mention it now.

[^items]: And also, in my bugged game, gives him back the ability to carry items.

[^fel_orcs]: They were renamed fel orcs in The Frozen Throne, and Reforged backported this name to Reign of Chaos too.

[^damage]: And that damage carries over when you gain control of the zeppelin after the cutscene ends. Attention to detail!
