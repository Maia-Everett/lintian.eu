As we focused on Thrall and Grom Hellscream, the Burning Legion and their sinister plans sort of fell by the wayside. This is about to change.

## The Blood of Mannoroth

All is well in the Ashenvale forest (the part that Grom isn't currently deforesting, anyway). Furbolgs are hanging out around a magic well.

Suddenly, that peace is interrupted when Mannoroth and Tichondrius teleport in.

On Archimonde's orders, they're plotting to kill the demigod [Cenarius](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Cenarius) before the Legion begins its invasion of Kalimdor. Mannoroth fought Cenarius before and would welcome another chance to meet him in battle, but he's crafty and rarely appears in the open.

Tichondrius suggests a plan. By despoiling Ashenvale, the orcs have incurred Cenarius's wrath and will soon face him. As they are, they stand little chance against him, but Tichondrius believes Mannoroth's blood can even the odds. As he once bound the orcs in a blood pact, so can his blood reinvigorate their demonic frenzy, making them unstoppable.

Mannoroth approves of the plan. He approaches the well and spills his blood into it, which gives it an ominous red glow.

Now the demons only have to wait --- and let Grom be himself.


## The Hunter of Shadows

## Where Wyverns Dare

{% figure [caption:"In Reforged, this mission is called &ldquo;Where Wind Riders Dare&rdquo;. This is because wyverns were renamed to wind riders in the expansion, and Reforged uses expansion units even for the Reign of Chaos campaign."] %}

## The Oracle
