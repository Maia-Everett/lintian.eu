All right! Let's start Warcraft 3: Reign of Chaos, and play through all the campaigns, in order.

But before I do that, there's one question to clear up...

<img alt="But what about Reforged?" src="/assets/wr/elephant_reforged.jpg" width="600" />

Thank you, Elephant in the Room. In January 2020, Blizzard forcefully replaced the original version of Warcraft 3 with a remaster called [Warcraft 3: Reforged](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Warcraft_III:_Reforged), whose quality has been... *controversial* to say the least. Reforged is now the only edition that you can download directly from Battle.net. It has two versions of the campaigns --- one nearly identical to the original version[^renames], with old models, and one with revamped models and some mission changes as well, including four completely revamped missions.

For this retrospective, I'm going to use the original edition of Warcraft 3 --- specifically, version 1.31, the last version of classic Warcraft 3 before it was overwritten with Reforged. It has all the original graphics and the unchanged campaigns, but also support for widescreen and 4K resolutions.


## Starting the Game

Back in 2002, I was the first student in my class to get my hands on Warcraft 3 at release. A local game store had downloaded it over the Internet (which, back then, was either tremendously slow or tremendously expensive), and I gave them a blank [CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CD-ROM) to burn it on, which I then shared with my friends while they were waiting for physical CD releases to appear in stores. It really is a special feeling to be the first person in your group to get hold of something new --- especially something this long anticipated.

I didn't have any manuals, either online or offline, and wasn't exposed to any spoilers. I went into the game, and the campaign story, completely blind, and when I launched `Warcraft III.exe` for the first time, I had absolutely no idea what to expect.

Reign of Chaos starts with a short cinematic where a human and an orc fight, but suddenly a meteor falls on the grass between them and turns into a [golem glowing sickly green](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Infernal). Then we see the human and the orc's severed arms lying in water as lightning strikes. By Warcraft standards that's pretty disturbing imagery --- and it's perhaps no surprise that it was toned down in [the Reforged version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InOzfjsKy5Y) of this cinematic.

We know it's a 2002 game because *holy compression artifacts, Batman*. Blizzard worked hard to fit its game onto a single 700 megabyte CD ([DVD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD) drives were for the rich) in an effort to make it as affordable and widely installable as possible. It looks even blockier on a 4K screen.

{% endfigure %}

The main menu is much more immersive than in previous games, intended to carry the impression of something heavy and physical. When you click a button, the chains lift the panel up, with the sound of chains moving, and a new panel comes down. It ends up feeling really immersive, and Hearthstone will later learn from Warcraft 3's example.

Single Player. Campaign. Here we go...

![Campaign selection](/assets/wr/WC3ScrnShot_030524_133426_04.jpg)

There are two difficulty levels: Normal and Hard. There's also an Easy mode, but it's only unlocked by failing a mission on Normal difficulty. Reforged makes an easy difficulty available from the start, only it calls it Story difficulty. Not being a challenge-oriented player, I'll play through the campaigns on Normal difficulty.

We click the label for the prologue campaign... and get treated with an absolutely *goosebumps-inducing* pre-rendered cinematic.

{% youtube "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2vm-QjK2xQ" %}

A raven on a lavishly rendered field observes a battle between humans and orcs. There are footmen, grunts, a catapult, and a [strange horned riding beast](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Kodo). Then meteors rain from the sky, and a mysterious cloaked man speaks to Thrall.

> The sands of time have run out, son of Durotan. The cries of war echo upon the winds. The remnants of the past scar the land, which is besieged once again... by conflict. Heroes arise to challenge fate, and lead their brethren to battle. As mortal armies rush blindly towards their doom... the Burning Shadow comes to consume us all. You must rally the Horde and lead your people to their destiny!

In his hut, Thrall awakens in shock.


## Chasing Visions

{% endfigure %}

Thrall rides out, dressed in his black armor, wielding the Doomhammer and riding a... black wolf? In *Lord of the Clans*, he bonded with a white wolf, and the generic Far Seer hero rides a white wolf too, so I don't know why they made this change.[^wolf] A mysterious raven, subtitled as "The Prophet"[^prophet], prompts Thrall to follow him, then flies away.

{% endfigure %}

When we finally gain control of Thrall, a narrator voice begins educating us in the basics of controlling units, and I mean the *very* basics. Blizzard really tried to make Warcraft 3 have as wide an appeal as possible, so the campaign doesn't assume you've ever played any RTS game before. Reign of Chaos has a very smooth learning curve, slowly increasing the difficulty from mission to mission, and from campaign to campaign, introducing concepts and letting you play with them in a less stressful environment, until the "final exam" last mission of the entire game.

Thrall is a hero unit. Though hero units existed in Warcraft 2, they were just beefed-up and recolored versions of regular units. Warcraft 3 expands the concept *far* beyond that, to something like a mini-RPG --- and these hero units are what a *lot* of the entire game design is built around. Hero units are far stronger and sturdier than regular units; they gain experience points and levels (with a maximum level of 10), unlock abilities and can carry up to six items. These all persist through missions and even across different campaigns.

In Warcraft 3, Thrall is a [Far Seer](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Far_Seer_(Warcraft_III)), a ranged spellcaster. He never actually fights with his hammer in melee --- instead, he hurls lightning balls at enemies. He starts with the Far Sight spell, which reveals a bit of terrain for a few seconds before the fog of war covers it. Personally, I don't find it that useful in the campaign except for revealing invisible units, but I assume it's pretty useful in multiplayer.

{% endfigure %}

Guided by the narrator, we proceed through the banners, learning about unexplored terrain and the fog of war along the way. Soon, Thrall reaches some orc buildings, where three grunts join him.

Here we start seeing what makes the Warcraft 3 campaigns so special: the missions are absolutely full of *stuff happening*. Warcraft 1 and 2 pitted player bases against each other, but otherwise their missions were just empty terrain. Warcraft 3 introduced very, *very* versatile scripting capabilities into the engine, and as a result, each mission is full of triggered events that liven up the gameplay. You never know what might be around the corner. Unlike custom mission objectives in Warcraft 2, none of these events are hardcoded: you can open the campaign maps in the *really* powerful map editor, inspect their scripts, and write your own scripts for custom maps --- and *boy*, did the fandom go [wild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_the_Ancients) with custom maps.

{% figure [caption:"Warcraft 3 starts the habit of characters inserting words from their native language into otherwise English speech. TV Tropes calls it <a href='https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PoirotSpeak'>Poirot Speak</a>,  and it always struck me as odd."] %}

{% endfigure %}

These screenshots very much showcase the aesthetic Warcraft 3 pioneered, which became standard for the franchise going forward. Everything is vibrant, colorful, distinct, exaggerated to be instantly recognizable in the middle of frantic RTS gameplay. This was an intentional choice on Blizzard's part. [In the words](https://arstechnica.com/features/2020/01/how-warcraft-iii-birthed-a-genre-changed-a-franchise-and-earned-a-reforge-ing/) of art director Samwise Didier:

> The art we created completely separated us from other companies' art styles. Where most companies were pushing realism and realistic characters, we opted for a comic book version of fantasy. We didn't want to be *Lord of the Rings* or standard D&D fantasy. We wanted our characters to be the superhero versions of fantasy characters, rock stars with battle axes, with each one of our heroes and units looking like they could take on a whole army by themselves.

Soon, Thrall and the grunts reach and kill a gnoll, then three gnolls (the narrator uses this encounter to teach the attack-move command), and Thrall levels up, learning the Chain Lightning spell. The path crosses a river, where we have our first encounter with one of the long-standing mascots of the Warcraft franchise: fish people called [murlocs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murloc).

{% figure [caption:"Shallow water can be crossed by land units. Deep water can't be crossed by anything, since you can't control or board ships in this game."] %}
![Chasing Visions](/assets/wr/WC3ScrnShot_031024_144036_21.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Like I said, the gameplay of Warcraft 3 is centered around hero units leading stacks of regular units. Heroes are supposed to gain experience, and experience is mostly gained from killing enemies. To ease the process, Warcraft 3 has groups of neutral enemies, called [creeps](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Creep), scattered across both campaign and multiplayer maps, often guarding gold mines for base expansion, beneficial map features, or dropping items when killed. To keep things fresh, there's a *lot* of different varieties of creeps --- enough that you could fill another D&D Monster Manual with the creatures seen in Warcraft 3 alone. Even on this tutorial map, there are no less than five different varieties of creeps, and that doesn't count your own playable orc units.

One of the murlocs drops a potion of mana. Mana is spent on all clickable *(active)* hero abilities. Some heroes have one *passive* ability, which simply provides a continuous benefit and doesn't need to be manually activated.

When we cross the river and reach the next banner, the night falls.

{% figure [caption:"Mmm, venison!"] %}
![Chasing Visions](/assets/wr/WC3ScrnShot_031024_144309_25.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

The day/night cycle is another innovation of Warcraft 3 compared to the first two installments (and Starcraft). Normally, units cannot see as far at night as they can during the day, and organic creep units sleep at night. One of the defining features of the fourth playable race in this game, the night elves, is that, fittingly for their name, they have gameplay features that interact with the day/night cycle.

Here is the first time that we actually get to make some choices. So far, the path we've followed has been completely linear. However, from this point on, there are some sidepaths we can explore for bonus experience and loot.

For example, there's an easy-to-miss side path leading to a forest clearing where a potion of healing is just lying around.

{% figure [caption:"I guess a passing adventurer dropped it."] %}
![Chasing Visions](/assets/wr/WC3ScrnShot_031024_144340_27.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Along with base building and combat micromanagement, exploration is one of the gameplay pillars of Warcraft 3. The maps contain very little unused space; instead they're filled to the brim with secrets and optional encounters. So far, [the Narrator](https://thestanleyparable.fandom.com/wiki/The_Narrator) has been hand-holding us across the main quest, but nobody encourages us to step off the beaten path and explore. This is yet another brilliant part of Warcraft 3's mission design, is that it simply counts on your own curiosity to drive you to these optional areas. You see that the main road is leading you to the mission objective, but there's also this sidepath leading into the black area --- what secrets does it hold? And in these baseless missions where you control a limited stack of units, there's usually no time pressure, and you can explore the entire map at your leisure.

And that is how you establish --- even with a small number of geographically small missions --- that the world is large, full of unexplored wilderness, and *there are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy*.

There are three more optional encounters here: a sleeping ogre, whom you can either pass by, or wake him and fight; three stone golems, who don't sleep at night (and are, annoyingly, immune to Thrall's Chain Lightning), one of whom drops a Ring of Protection +1; and a camp of sleeping forest trolls, who drop a Manual of Health that *permanently* increases Thrall's hit points.

This game was *heavily* inspired by D&D and its clones, in addition to classic RTS mechanics, and influenced a lot of WoW's design in turn.

{% figure [caption:"In Warcraft 1 and 2, storytelling was something that happened <em>between</em> missions. Here, heroes talk throughout missions, all the time, and reveal lore tidbits for players new to the franchise."] %}
![Chasing Visions](/assets/wr/WC3ScrnShot_031024_144607_32.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Finally, our little party reaches the Prophet, who has been hovering in raven form all this time, patiently waiting for Thrall to clear the map and gather phat lewt. It's just the world that is ending, after all. No pressure.

{% figure [caption:"So Thrall is a savior figure who was found by foster parents as an infant and is now going to lead his people to their promised land. No religious parallels here, no, siree."] %}
![Chasing Visions](/assets/wr/WC3ScrnShot_031024_144850_38.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

The Prophet laughs at the suggestion of being human, and Thrall senses that "the demons... are returning". The spirits, conveniently, tell Thrall to trust the stranger, and, having no real reason to say in the human lands and every reason to explore new horizons, he decides to gather the Horde for departure.

I have to note that characters' reactions to the Prophet in this story are very binary. Either they immediately trust him because of the spirits/a hunch/a dream, or are immediately dismissive and refuse to even entertain the possibility of there being a grain of truth in his words. Nobody really sits down to have a prolonged conversation with him. How does he know all this? Why is Kalimdor so vital to saving the world? Why can't it be done any other way? Why does he fly around making cryptic messages to leaders instead of trying to spread the word to the people? He pretty much refuses to explain anything and expects people to blindly abandon their homes at his word.

These are good questions to ask, but it's only something you notice after replaying the game or [thinking hard about the story](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FridgeLogic), not something that pulls you out of the story. Which is to say that storytelling problems are [a gradient](https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=25227) rather than black and white. Warcraft 3's story is not exactly deep; it's built around familiar tropes, and the characters are only as developed as they need to be to tell this particular story --- that is, they're pretty flat, but still *miles* ahead of the first two games. Warcraft 3 storytelling "cheats", like characters sensing things or immediately trusting each other, are narrative shortcuts meant to tell a coherent story in the RTS format, not something that shatters your suspension of disbelief and [yanks you back into the Primary World](https://onthecobblestoneroad.com/fantasy-worldbuilding/#primary-world-and-secondary-world-fantasy).

The cutscene writing deserves special praise. The cinematography is basic by modern standards, but back then, in-engine cutscenes smoothly flowing into and out of RTS gameplay were a novel thing. And while the dialogue gets flak for being a [cliche storm](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ClicheStorm), personally I think it's exactly what it should be for this kind of game. It's memorable, gets the point across, it's *very* quotable, and it's short enough that it never overstays its welcome. Warcraft 3 is very tightly paced; the developers have taken all measures they could to prevent the missions from dragging out, and the cutscenes are just short enough that they don't bog down the pacing. They also don't state the obvious and don't repeat mission objectives verbatim.

As amazing as [some fan-made campaigns](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/chronicles-of-the-second-war-tides-of-darkness.327574/) are, I've found out that their dialogue writers can learn from the cutscenes in original Warcraft 3 campaigns, their style, and their purpose: telling a tightly plotted story, not providing long lore dumps.


## Departures



## What's Next?

And that was part one of the prologue campaign. Next up is part two.

"What part two? Doesn't this campaign only have two missions?"
