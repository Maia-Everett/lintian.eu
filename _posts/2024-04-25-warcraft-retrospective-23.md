Last time, we stopped at the shocking twist of an undead-looking Arthas returning to Lordaeron and killing his father, cementing his fall to darkness. And please hear me out: this might be an unpopular opinion, but while the human campaign was a compelling story, I don't think its *epilogue*, specifically, was executed that well.

Sure, by the end of the campaign, Arthas fell to extreme "ends justify the means" thinking, but he still committed all these atrocities in the name of saving the people of Lordaeron from the Scourge --- because he thought *he* was the only one willing to what it took. Everyone, and everything, was expendable in the name of victory over the undead, and [sickness was to be purged](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1796988-final-fantasy-xiv). He was a Scarlet Crusader before there was a Scarlet Crusade. A [well-intentioned extremist](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WellIntentionedExtremist). He was [Redcloak](https://oots.fandom.com/wiki/Redcloak), having gone too far to save his people to stop now.

At the end of the campaign, he was not Darth Vader.

Actually, speaking of Darth Vader, there's a similar problem with *his* story in the prequels.<!--more-->[^prequels] In fact, it's a problem that often arises in pop fantasy, which a friend of mine likes to call...


## Flipping the Alignment Switch

In the original trilogy, once it was revealed that Darth Vader was Luke's father, it utterly clashed with the image of the paragon Jedi that Obi-Wan painted. The viewers had every right to assume that the elder Skywalker's fall was tragic, perhaps exploiting some flaws in his otherwise noble psyche, and it gave Yoda's warnings of the Dark Side so much more weight. If Obi-Wan's best friend became a tyrant choking his officers for every perceived slight, then *anyone* could fall to the Dark Side --- including Luke himself.

And then, much later, *Revenge of the Sith* came out. It promised to answer a long-standing mystery: why *did* Anakin Skywalker turn evil?

...Ummm...

I don't think that movie gives an adequate answer. Sure, Anakin was a loose cannon with plenty of grievances against the Jedi order, but it's a *big* jump from "Mace Windu tried to kill this self-admitted Sith Lord on the spot instead of giving him a trial" to "Let's kill all the Jedi, including the younglings". *Revenge of the Sith* makes it look like the moment you embrace the Dark Side and are given a Sith name, you instantly turn into an evil caricature of yourself with no moral inhibitions. It's not that pre-fall Anakin is a particularly nice person, but the moment he becomes Darth Vader, it's like he becomes a different person entirely. Palpatine flipped his alignment switch.

We see this pattern continue in Knights of the Old Republic. Now, I love that game. It well deserves its universal acclaim. Its storytelling is very impressive... *for a 2003 game*. By modern standards, it hasn't aged that well, and a lot of its plot hinges on, if anything, an even more simplistic handling of the Dark Side than in *Revenge of the Sith*. You redeem a fallen Jedi by flipping her alignment switch. The villain kidnaps one of your companions and tortures her until the torture flips her alignment switch. Then you beat her in battle, which, if you choose Light Side dialogue options, flips her alignment switch back.[^kotor] The game handles "falling to the Dark Side" as something binary, and "redemption" as something that means you're back as your good self and all the evil stuff you did doesn't count.

This, of course, ignores the very real and tragic reasons that drive people in real life to commit atrocities.

Arthas's transformation from the well-intentioned sociopath at the end of the human campaign to the completely amoral monster in the undead campaign has a significant gap in it. A gap that is --- unlike *everything else in the campaign* --- not shown, but told us in six short lines of text.

And I'm sorry, but to me, it really doesn't cut it.


## Trudging Through the Ashes

![Trudging Through the Ashes](/assets/wr/20240424230647_1.jpg)

The jarring disconnect between the two campaigns begins with the very first cutscene. 

{% figure [caption:"Come on now! He's red, and Mal'Ganis was green!"] %}
![Trudging Through the Ashes](/assets/wr/20240424230703_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Arthas is teleported to a spot between three obelisks with some kind of green glow. He didn't seem to expect this, and is disoriented. He now rides an undead horse that he got... somewhere. The two guys who accompanied him to the throne room are nowhere to be found. None of this is explained.

This new dreadlord introduces himself as [Tichondrius](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Tichondrius), a messenger of the Lich King, and he says that by killing his father, Arthas has passed his first test. He explains that the reason Arthas feels no remorse or pity is because Frostmourne, which was forged by the Lich King himself[^frostmourne], claimed Arthas's soul.

> "No! I must kill the undead" [he shouted](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Fanfic/DoomRepercussionsOfEvil)  
> The sword said "No, Arthas. You are the undead"  
> And then Arthas was a death knight.

Which... I suppose explains why Arthas has lost all his remaining moral inhibitions, but it doesn't explain why his *goals* changed. Why has he suddenly turned from trying to stop the Scourge to working for them? Does he have a choice in this matter? Is he under a mental compulsion, a slave of the Lich King, or has Frostmourne basically rewired him to the point that he's not Arthas anymore, but just some... thing puppeting his body and using his memories? What are *his own* goals? What does he himself want now, as opposed to what Tichondrius and the Lich King want him to do?

The game isn't interested in exploring these questions. It presents Arthas's personality overwrite as a given and acts as if all he cares about now is doing whatever the Lich King asks of him. The end result is that undead Arthas feels like a completely different person who just happens to have human Arthas's memories.[^undead_arthas]

But something still isn't right. In the human campaign, the Lich King[^dark_lord] had a direct line to Arthas through Frostmourne, giving him a surprise order to kill Mal'Ganis. Here, the Lich King never contacts Arthas directly, and instead all the orders come from Tichondrius. It doesn't seem like anything happened to the sword in the interim, so it's weird that the game sets up the plot element of "the Lich King can covertly contact Arthas behind the dreadlords' backs" and then never uses it again.

The first task Tichondrius gives is reassembling the Cult of the Damned, which went into hiding after Arthas dealt it a blow at Andorhal. This doesn't sound like that big a deal, really. The acolytes are blending in among the peasantry, so all Arthas needs to do is find one acolyte outside town and ask them to visit the other acolytes in hiding and tell them to meet at some secret gathering place. Simple, efficient, and doesn't draw attention.

...No, of course instead he's going to charge into town with two very conspicuous ghouls. Sigh.

{% figure [caption:"Those bundles of lumber the ghouls are carrying are a result of me accidentally right-clicking a tree. The ghouls are the undead faction's lumber gatherers."] %}

Our forces are paltry. Arthas, who was a level 10 powerhouse uber-paladin, is now a level 1 death knight. While you could justify this by saying he's weakened because the Light abandoned him, losing his entire inventory really makes no sense story-wise, nor does the fact that he now does Normal damage, when Chaos damage was one of the big selling points of picking up Frostmourne in the first place. Last I checked, it's still the same sword. Warcraft 3 is usually good at [integrating gameplay with story](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfGameplayAndStoryIntegration), which makes the few times it *doesn't* do that all the more jarring.

We have to search the town for acolytes in hiding, who look like peasants tinted red. Once found, they reveal their true allegiance as acolytes and teleport away. The town is patrolled by footmen, captains, and eventually knights, and your forces consist of a squishy level 1 hero and two really squishy ghouls, so you can't really afford to face the guards in open combat --- at least, more than a single unit at a time --- and instead are supposed to evade them.

Luckily, Arthas starts with the Death Coil ability, which is the exact opposite of his old starting ability. The paladin's Holy Light heals living allies and [hurts undead](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReviveKillsZombie), and Death Coil... well...

![Healing hurts them](/assets/wr/healing_hurts_them.png)

The actual mission is kind of a slog. It's mostly a stealth mission, and you're given a shade (an invisible scout unit) to look ahead for acolytes in hiding before you approach them with Arthas, and there are twenty of them scattered across town. There are some Easter eggs, like two fistfighting villagers named [Robert and Tyler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_Club), and places to explore like the bandit camp in the northwest. There are actually more acolytes around than you need to rescue, practically guaranteeing that you'll miss some secrets on your first playthrough.

Once the acolytes are rallied, Tichondrius moves to the next stage of the plan, which is...

Wow. All of Arthas's progress against the Scourge in the human campaign is being undone, fast.





[^prequels]: Assuming you acknowledge the prequels, of course.

[^kotor]: KOTOR 2, which had different writers, portrays the Light and Dark Sides in a more nuanced way, but these margins are too small to talk about that game.

[^frostmourne]: Remember this. For much, *much* later.

[^undead_arthas]: Actually, when *did* Arthas turn undead? We weren't shown that, either.

[^dark_lord]: Called the Dark Lord there for some reason. But in this campaign, everyone suddenly switches to calling him the Lich King instead.
