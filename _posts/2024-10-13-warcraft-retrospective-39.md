And so we have traced the shaping of the Warcraft setting as we broadly know it: from a barely defined pseudo-medieval kingdom beset by savage evil alien invaders to a large, sprawling world of at least three continents[^continents] populated by many different races, with a history stretching back over ten thousand years, in a universe full of other worlds, where mortals are but ants compared to enigmatic cosmic forces, from the seemingly benevolent Titans to the omnicidal Burning Legion.

It's been a wild journey, and now that we're done with Warcraft 3, which formed the foundation of the modern Warcraft setting, we can finally answer the question: What is that much-lauded **feel of Warcraft**? What is it that gives Warcraft its distict flavor, separating it from the likes of Dungeons & Dragons and other fantasy games, both tabletop and computer, that came before and after it?

What follows is merely my interpretation, which, of course, I don't claim to be authoritative.

## Conclusion

We have journeyed through the origins of the Warcraft setting, through Blizzard's Experimental Era (Warcraft 1, 2, and Warcraft Adventures) and part of the Classic Era (Warcraft 3 and The Frozen Throne). We have seen the setting evolve through the games, and we have seen novels give it much-needed depth.

Warcraft 3, with its greatly expanded world, formed the skeleton of the setting. It jumped widely from location to location and from character to character, using broad, sweeping characterization. After it, installments that built deep rather than wild fleshed out the world of Azeroth, putting some much-needed meat on these bones. I'm talking, of course, about the tie-in series of D&D supplements, Warcraft: The Roleplaying Game.

...Oh, and World of Warcraft too.

Where Warcraft 3 built wide, giving us new lands, new races and new factions, the RPG and WoW built deep, mostyl focusing on fleshing out the material we had in broad strokes. In doing so, they turned Warcraft into a setting with enough detail that roleplayers, myself included, could create and play out our own stories in the world that Blizzard built.

But that would be a story for another time.

[^continents]: Four if you count Pandaria, but technically we don't yet know where it is or whether it's even a continent.
