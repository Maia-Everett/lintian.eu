And so we have traced the shaping of the Warcraft setting as we broadly know it: from a barely defined pseudo-medieval kingdom beset by savage evil alien invaders to a large, sprawling world of at least three continents[^continents] populated by many different races, with a history stretching back over ten thousand years, in a universe full of other worlds, where mortals are but ants compared to enigmatic cosmic forces, from the seemingly benevolent Titans to the omnicidal Burning Legion.

It's been a wild journey, and now that we're done with Warcraft 3, which formed the foundation of the modern Warcraft setting, we can finally answer the question: What is that much-lauded **feel of Warcraft**? What is it that gives Warcraft its distict flavor, separating it from the likes of Dungeons & Dragons and other fantasy games, both tabletop and computer, that came before and after it?

What follows is merely my interpretation, which, of course, I don't claim to be authoritative. Like I [said long ago](/2023/11/02/warcraft-retrospective-1/), Warcraft means different things to different people.

## The Three Pillars of Warcraft

When discussing [the feel of Star Wars](https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=51312), Shamus Young spoke of the three pillars supporting that setting: the world of the Force (Jedi and Sith), the world of politics (of queens, senators, empires and alliances), and the seedy underworld (of criminals, mercenaries, and bounty hunters). Similarly, I think we can speak of three pillars supporting the Warcraft setting:

* **War.** This was largely the sole pillar of Warcraft 1 and 2, and to some people it's still the main appeal of the franchise. This is the war where massive armies clash in epic battles that decide the fate of whole continents, if not the whole world. This pillar is associated with great military leaders like Lothar and Orgrim Doomhammer. Wars in Warcraft can be fought between established factions like the Alliance and Horde, or against an evil threatening to destroy the world, like the Scourge and the Burning Legion.
* **Exploration and adventure.** Azeroth is a big world full of unexplored untamed wilderness, and its civilizations rely on pioneers, pathfinders, and sellswords to push their influence into the vast expanse separating the settlements. Anything can be lurking in the blank spots of the map, from small barbarian tribes to ancient vaults to eldritch monsters sealed away by the precursors. Rexxar's campaign is an example of a Warcraft story where exploration takes an important part, as are many outdoor activities in World of Warcraft.
* **Cosmic lore.** This is the domain of barely comprehensible cosmic forces like the Titans, Old Gods, and Burning Legion, who clashed with each other before this world was even shaped. Compared to the vastness of the Great Dark Beyond and the Twisting Nether, Azeroth is just a tiny blue dot floating in the cosmos, and no matter how deeply we delve into cosmic lore, we will only scratch the surface. Unlike H.P. Lovecraft and friends, however, cosmic stories in Warcraft are not marked by utter hopelessness; the world *can* be saved, if at a great cost.

Individual characters and factions in Warcraft do not need to fall squarely into one pillar. For example, [Brann Bronzebeard](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Brann_Bronzebeard)[^brann] is a famed dwarven explorer who wrote much of the description of the lands in the Warcraft RPG, but his primary interest is learning about the Titans and their effect on the world and its races --- which means he's both a trailblazer and a researcher of cosmic lore.

I strongly suspect that different players have their own favorite pillars, which colors their perception of different Warcraft media.[^personally] Some players swear by the Alliance--Horde conflict, while others consider it a millstone dragging the franchise down. Some love long-winded introductions to new lands and their inhabitants, while others find them a waste of time and a distraction from what they're really after. This, unfortunately, makes it hard for players in different camps to find common ground in evaluating the quality of Warcraft media.

> **Alice:** Dragonflight was boring. Everyone was friends, it was World of Peacecraft, and they defanged both centaurs and dragons into peace-loving goodies-two-shoes. I preferred Battle for Azeroth, which had a real war with real stakes.  
> **Bob:** Battle for Azeroth had a stupid and contrived war, and I'm glad the Alliance and Horde are at better terms now. Not everything has to be continent-wrecking. Dragonflight had a massive landmass to explore, with plenty of local lore and sidequests fleshing out the cultures.

This isn't really an argument about the *quality* of these two expansions, but rather about personal preferences for the types of stories Alice and Bob like being told in the Warcraft setting. For some people, Battle for Azeroth and Dragonflight were *their* Warcraft, and for others, they weren't Warcraft at all. It might be no coincidence, then, that the most well-received and nostalgic installments --- Warcraft 3, Wrath of the Lich King, Mists of Pandaria, and Legion --- catered to all three pillars.

## Conclusion

We have journeyed through the origins of the Warcraft setting, through Blizzard's Experimental Era (Warcraft 1, 2, and Warcraft Adventures) and part of the Classic Era (Warcraft 3 and The Frozen Throne). We have seen the setting evolve through the games, and we have seen novels give it much-needed depth.

Warcraft 3, with its greatly expanded world, formed the skeleton of the setting. It jumped widely from location to location and from character to character, using broad, sweeping characterization. After it, installments that built deep rather than wild fleshed out the world of Azeroth, putting some much-needed meat on these bones. I'm talking, of course, about the tie-in series of D&D supplements, [Warcraft: The Roleplaying Game](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Warcraft:_The_Roleplaying_Game).

...Oh, and World of Warcraft too.

Where Warcraft 3 built wide, giving us new lands, new races and new factions, the RPG and WoW built deep, mostyl focusing on fleshing out the material we had in broad strokes. In doing so, they turned Warcraft into a setting with enough detail that roleplayers, myself included, could create and play out our own stories in the world that Blizzard built.

But that would be a story for another time.

[^continents]: Four if you count Pandaria, but technically we don't yet know where it is or whether it's even a continent.

[^brann]: We haven't met Brann in-game yet, but he's the younger brother of Magni, the king of Ironforge, and Muradin of human campaign fame.

[^personally]: Personally, I'm a fan of the exploration pillar, which explains why I liked Rexxar's campaign and was excited for Mists of Pandaria and Dragonflight.
