Last time, we saw Arthas lead the Scourge to the outskirts of Silvermoon, where he plans to raise Kel'Thuzad at the high elves' sacred font of power, the Sunwell. Meanwhile, this was playing in the background.

The undead theme is an interesting departure from the others. Unlike the noble and triumphant human theme or the rousing and warlike orc theme, this one isn't energetic. It's eerie, haunting, and foreboding. Something foul is in the air, creeping on you and sapping your resolve --- and the growls of the walking dead and the clanging of unholy mechanical contraptions will be the last sounds you hear before your life, too, is drained away.

## The Fall of Silvermoon

At the new undead base on the outskirts of Silvermoon, Tichondrius briefs Arthas on the Sunwell. There is animosity between the two, and Arthas suspects that the dreadlord suspects something about Kel'Thuzad's ghost aiding him. Once again, exposition is worked into the dialogue without feeling *too* unnatural. Well... maybe.

By Warcraft 3 standards, this map is pretty big, and you're under pressure here, as your starting gold mine doesn't have that much gold in it, and the only other ones are under enemy control. Sylvanas mounts an attack almost immediately.

{% figure [caption:"&ldquo;I was a valiant but brash defender of my people who turned undead, and she-- Actually, this gives me an idea.&rdquo;"] %}

{% endfigure %}

You're on your own against Sylvanas's base and the pretty sizable defenses of Silvermoon, but thankfully, the latter remain ignorant of you --- for now. Soon, however, Sylvanas begins sending runners to Silvermoon, and if even one makes it through, the city will be alerted to your presence and begin mounting assaults on your base as well. Luckily, the runners have quite some distance to cover, and in a cutscene, you get introduced to just the right unit to intercept them: gargoyles.

{% figure [caption:"The mining pick is the traditional regalia of high elf messengers!"] %}

{% endfigure %}

Gargoyles are light and fast, and there aren't any enemies on the possible routes runners can take, so stopping them isn't hard as long as you aren't distracted by something else. Still, it's best to take out Sylvanas's base as soon as possible before your gold mine runs out.

In this mission, Arthas gets his ultimate ability: Animate Dead. It picks corpses of the most powerful six units in the vicinity, whether allies or enemies, and raises them to fight for you for forty seconds. Best of all, they're invulnerable until they expire, and they can be targeted with Death Pact to heal the death knight without killing them.[^animate_dead] Bizarrely, in the original and very iconic Russian translation of Warcraft 3[^russian_translation], Animate Dead was named "Galvanization". A reference to making corpses twitch with electric current, perhaps?

Once Sylvanas's base falls, Arthas mortally wounds her in a cutscene. She begs for a clean death, but after everything she's put him through, Arthas isn't quite willing to oblige. Instead, he gruesomely draws out her soul, turning her into into a banshee.

{% figure [caption:"&ldquo;I would. I played truth or dare with Kel'Thuzad, you see.&rdquo;"] %}
![The Fall of Silvermoon](/assets/wr/20240429203257_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Weirdly, this is where Sylvanas's involvement in the Reign of Chaos storyline ends entirely. You get her as a unique banshee unit --- a regular unit you can lose, not even a hero --- and she doesn't appear at all in any subsequent missions.

At this point you also unlock the regular banshee unit. Banshees are all-female ghosts of slain elves who make it very clear that they're fighting for you against their will, with tortured cries like "You brought me back?!", "If I must" and "I must obey". They start as debuffers, cursing enemies to a 33% miss chance, but their most iconic ability is Possession, which sacrifices the banshee to permanently take control of an enemy unit.

Now it's time to turn towards Silvermoon. I attacked from the western side because it was closer, which turned out to not be optimal, because as soon as the city got alerted, they sent a (generic human) archmage against my relatively lightly defended base. As I was building banshees at the base at that time, I turned their own swordsmen and archers against them, which felt satisfying in an evil bastard kind of way.

While Silvermoon has two bases, one on the west and one in the east, they don't pose that much of a threat compared to Sylvanas, and destroying Silvermoon isn't your objective anyway --- securing the Sunwell is. So you have a lot of options for this part of the mission, and correspondingly a lot of replay value. For example, while the game doesn't tell you this, you can possess an elven peasant (who, hilariously, has the voice lines of a human peasant) and build up their entire technology tree.

{% figure [caption:"But where do the units come from? Are they some kind of elven renegades who're happy to serve an evil death knight as long as they can take revenge against the establishment?"] %}

The Sunwell itself is protected by towers and... rock golems?

The Quel'Thalas missions seem kind of phoned in, to the point that I wonder if they were an afterthought to pad out the campaign. Not only do they drag out without much plot happening, but the high elves reuse a lot of human assets, some cut Alliance units[^cut_units], and the only named character is Sylvanas, who isn't seen or even mentioned anywhere in the rest of the campaign. Once you defeat her, you face no more named elves until the end of the mission.

Another interesting thing to note is that while the manual and loading screen maps place the Sunwell across a strait from Quel'Thalas, in the actual mission it's located *in* Silvermoon, right at the center of it. It makes sense, considering the previous mission established beyond all doubt that Arthas has no means of crossing water on his own. So if some hypothetical remake of Warcraft 3 made the mission map more WoW-lore-accurate, I'd expect them to remember the plot point introduced just a mission ago--

{% endfigure %}

Sigh. Reforged completely revamped this mission to fit WoW geography and aesthetics, but in the process, introduced not one, but two plot holes. We'll talk about it in due time. For now, I'll just have to accept that Arthas somehow got unexplained ice powers between missions that take place mere moments apart--

...Fine, fine, I'll let it go.

In the original, the Sunwell just reuses a generic fountain model. Arthas announces the end of Quel'Thalas for their stubborn resistance, then Kel'Thuzad basks in the Sunwell's golden glow, tainting in in the process, and is reborn as a lich.

{% endfigure %}

Now Arthas asks Kel'Thuzad to uphold his end of the bargain and tell him about the dreadlords. And he will --- but not here.


## The Revelation

{% figure [caption:"I call shenanigans on the writers. No way they came all the way here from Silvermoon in just three days."] %}
![The Revelation](/assets/wr/20240429205834_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

While our heroes (for a given definition of "hero") were busy turning Quel'Thalas into a wasteland, winter came to Lordaeron. In a mountain pass in Alterac, Kel'Thuzad reveals that the Lich King foresaw Arthas killing him, and actually selected the prince as his champion before the Scourge even began. As for the dreadlords...

{% figure [caption:"Where did all those skulls come from? Did Arthas and Kel'Thuzad just put random skulls on pikes before stopping by to have this conversation?"] %}
![The Revelation](/assets/wr/20240429205914_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

And we're actually shown the Burning Legion!

{% figure [caption:"&ldquo;If the Legion can open portals between worlds, why can't they just open a portal to ours?&rdquo; â€” &ldquo;Shh.&rdquo;"] %}
![The Revelation](/assets/wr/20240429205936_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

The plague in Lordaeron and the sacking of Quel'Thalas were just the prelude to a demonic invasion. The Legion used the Scourge to soften the world's defenses, eradicating the forces that could resist their arrival. Now it's the time to move to the next stage of the plan: summoning the demon lord who will actually lead the invasion.


## Blackrock & Roll, Too!

[^animate_dead]: This isn't how the ability worked at release, though. It used to raise the dead for 120 seconds without invulnerability, making Animate Dead basically a worse version of the paladin's Resurrection.

[^russian_translation]: Which was outsourced to a Russian company that took a *lot* of creative liberties. Blizzard later made a Russian translation of WoW in-house, translating the terminology and names closer to the original, and all subsequent Warcraft games used these new translations consistently. Reforged was redubbed, too.

[^cut_units]: Including the dragonhawk, which later got reused for the expansion.
