And so we get to the final campaign of Reign of Chaos: the night elf one. And... oh boy, it's going to be awkward for me to talk about it.

It's no secret that I like night elves. This website is, after all, named after a night elf [roleplay character of mine](https://lintian.eu/lintian/). It's furthermore no secret that I like elves as a fantasy concept, in general --- though it might surprise people who know me as the [Argent Dawn realm forum](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/c/argent-dawn/190)'s resident elf-lover that this basically only applies to two races in all of fantasy that I know of. Most varieties of elves that have been invented by fantasy writers over the past few decades leave me either annoyed or indifferent, except for exactly two of them: Tolkien elves, and night elves.

Before you raise your pitchforks (or bows), let me say a few words in my defense.

## The Many Faces of Elves

In the beginning, there was [Germanic folklore and mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elf). I'm not actually qualified to talk about it, and at any rate, any cursory overview of a folkloric concept will inevitably involve simplifications and generalizations. Premodern conceptions of elves have apparently ranged from diminutive to human-sized; they have at various times been conflated with fairies or used as am umbrella term for mythological beings that included forest spirits, dwarves, and even trolls; and then there's Norse mythology with its [distinctions] between light elves *(Ljósálfar)*, dark elves *(Dökkálfar)* and black elves *(Svartálfar)*, the latter two of which may have been the same or different, or they may have been dwarves, or distinct from them. It's a bit of a mess.

What's important for our purposes is what I've already mentioned before when [talking about orcs](https://lintian.eu/2024/01/28/warcraft-retrospective-12/): mythological beings were conceptualized as an [Other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_(philosophy)) defined primarily by their interactions with humans, part of the wild, unknown world beyond the safety of civilization. Elves could help or hinder humans; they could charm human onlookers, or bring diseases upon the townsfolk, or kidnap human children and replace them with changelings, but at any rate they were *them*, they were *other*, and storytellers' audiences weren't asked to put themselves in their shoes.
