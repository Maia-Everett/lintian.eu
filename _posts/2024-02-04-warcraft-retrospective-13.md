We're now taking a break from games. 

After Warcraft Adventures failed to materialize, Blizzard released a series of four books to set the stage for Warcraft 3. Today, we'll be looking into *[Of Blood and Honor](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Of_Blood_and_Honor)* by Chris Metzen, a simple, low-stakes story about a human, an orc, and a tower.

This is a fairly short book. With only 128 paper pages, Warcraft Wiki classifies it as a novella. I went in blind, knowing only the basic premise and not expecting much. In some ways, I was pleasantly surprised. To talk

## Thoughts


### The Names

When I opened the book, my immediate question was: what's with the names?

Tirion Fordring. Mirador. Arden. Barthilas. And yet you're telling me this story takes place in a pseudo-European human kingdom?

So far, Warcraft seems to be going with a "detached fantasy" feel for its human names without reference to any particular real-life culture, even though the human nations are very obviously European coded. The only real-life name has been Lothar, whereas everyone else has had fantasy names like Daelin, Terenas, and Aegwyn. *Of Blood and Honor* continues this tradition, but since we've gone down from kings and generals to individual knights and citizens, it ends up feeling weird to me.

The phonetics of names we think of as "generic fantasy" were heavily inspired, of course, by *The Lord of the Rings*, whose naming system is largely based on Tolkien's constructed Elvish language, [Sindarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sindarin), seen in names like Legolas "green leaf", Minas Tirith "tower of guard", and Mordor "black land". Later fantasy writers subconsciously borrowed the phonetics without the meaning behind them, resulting in, say, [Forgotten Realms](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Forgotten_Realms) having names like [Nasher Alagondar](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Nasher_Alagondar), [Cormanthor](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Cormanthor) and [Beregost](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Beregost).[^aglarond] You know, the kind of names a dungeon master makes up on the fly.

And sometimes these writers make up names that end up accidentally meaning something in Sindarin, which results in them being [unintentionally funny](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm) if you know enough Elvish roots. So when I'm reading about Tirion Fordring and his stallion Mirador, I can't help but wonder why the character is named Lookson North-hammer and his horse Treasury-land. It's like reading a fantasy book taking place in a mountainous land of samurai, shoguns, ninjas, sakuras, and thatched-roof dojos, but for some reason, all characters have names like Silevir, Alagos, and Nalloriel.

But maybe it only feels weird in hindsight because I'm so used to the widespread use of real-life Anglophone names in Warcraft 3 and World of Warcraft. I'll get to that later.


### The Prose and the Story

The prose is... fine. It's harder for me to judge than it would be for a native English speaker, but it seems just right, neither obtusely lofty, nor patronizingly simplistic. There are some awkward word choices[^dynamic], and occasionally, the narrator has a weird habit of explicitly spelling out the characters' feelings even when it's evident from the text. For example:

>  “The future of our people is no longer your concern,” Barthilas said coldly. “I rule Hearthglen now, Tirion. And as long as I do, I swear that there will never be peace with the orcs! On my parents’ departed souls, I swear that every last orc in Lordaeron will burn for what they’ve done!”
> 
> Tirion was shocked by Barthilas’ words. There was no reasoning with the young Paladin. He had given over completely to his rage and grief.

I'm also saddened that the story's only female character, Tirion's wife Karandra, is so flat. She exists only to constantly nag Tirion about putting his duties and principles above his family and refuses to listen to reason. You know, because women always choose emotions over reason or something. Unfortunately, this won't be the first [shallow love interest](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Aggra) Metzen will write.

And, of course, there's the protagonist-centered morality at the end. Thrall's orcs rampage through Stratholme, killing numerous human guards who were just doing one job, but hey, that's a small price to pay for saving a single named orc!


## What's Next?

Next we'll be looking at *[Day of the Dragon](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Day_of_the_Dragon)*, the first Warcraft book by Richard A. Knaak. Whereas in Warcraft 2 and Warcraft Adventures, Alexstrasza and Deathwing were simply powerful dragons who just happened to be red and black respectively, this book forever changed the way dragons were written in all Warcraft media going forward --- both for good and for ill.

[^dynamic]: Metzen seems to be fond of using "dynamic" to mean "vigorous", as it's also how he would later characterize Varian Wrynn.
