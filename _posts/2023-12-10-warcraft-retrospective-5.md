Last time, we ended on Warcraft 1's multiple-choice finale. Either the orcs conquered Stormwind Keep, or the humans drove them back into the portal they came from.

This presented a problem for any future storytellers. When a game has multiple mutually exclusive endings, the writers of its sequels typically [declare a single ending canon](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CuttingOffTheBranches) and proceed from there. And usually, [they choose the ending where the good guys win](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NoCanonForTheWicked).

In Star Wars, there are games where the player can make the protagonist fall to the dark side and possibly even take over the galaxy, such as [Knights of the Old Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_(video_game)) and [Jedi Knight: Dark Forces 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Jedi_Knight:_Dark_Forces_II). But other Star Wars stories that follow the events of these games make these endings non-canon. The first expansion to [Neverwinter Nights 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverwinter_Nights_2), Mask of the Betrayer, assumes that the player defeated the big bad instead of joining him. Sure, these are all RPGs or shooters, but there are strategy examples as well. For example, [Heroes of Might and Magic 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_II) tells the story of a war for succession between two heirs to the throne, one good and the other evil, and [the sequel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_III) reveals that the good brother won.[^good_endings]

The writers of Warcraft 2 did something that was not entirely unprecedented, but still very rare to see in video games. They continued the story from the ending where the bad guys won.[^bad_guys]


## Seeds of the Sequel

After the success of Warcraft 1, Blizzard began brainstorming the sequel. Wanting to subvert player expectations, they considered different ideas, [one of which](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/-quot-rock-balls-quot-the-making-of-warcraft-ii) was having orcs invade the modern world; they even brainstormed cinematics with dragons battling fighter jets. They rejected this idea pretty soon and decided to keep Warcraft in the fantasy world of the first game.

Interestingly, the idea for a crossover with the modern world came from Blizzard co-founder Allen Adham, and artist Stu Rose fought him for it. In the end, Adham yielded. It's notable because the people in charge of the game realized that their "awesome" idea would do the budding franchise more harm than good, and rejected it early before sunk cost became an issue; and that it was better to flesh out the setting they already had than to subvert expectations for the sake of subverting expectations.

So the plans were revised.

The new vision of the project was still ambitious. Not only did the designers want to have naval and aerial units, they also wanted to move beyond the strictly one-on-one battles of the first game. On multiplayer maps, players could now have allies, as well as multiple enemies. The same was true of the campaign. This necessitated introducing more sides into the conflict, both in gameplay and in lore.

And to do that, they needed to expand the world.


## Enter Chris Metzen

{% figure [caption:"The humble beginnings."] %}
![Chris Metzen in Warcraft 1 credits](/assets/wr/wc1_metzen.png)
{% endfigure %}

This series will turn a lot more critical later on as we move to World of Warcraft and its expansions. Generally I will aim to avoid naming and shaming. While I have my own theories on who wrote what[^first_ones], we don't truly know the full story of Blizzard's creative decisions, and likely never will. The purpose of this series is to examine the franchise as a whole, not to cast blame. But [Chris Metzen](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Chris_Metzen)'s influence on Warcraft cannot be overstated.

In Warcraft 1, Metzen was just one of several artists. He joined the project late in development, and we find his name near the bottom of the credits, as one of the manual illustrators. At that time, he was *nineteen years old*, and he had a knack for coming up with interesting crazy ideas and pitching them to the rest of the team. This caught the interest of the higher-ups, who, to Metzen's surprise, just outright [put him in charge](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Warcraft_II_credits) of Warcraft 2 story and design.

Opinions on Metzen as a writer are polarized. Personally, I think different writers have different strengths and weaknesses, and the successful ones leverage their strengths while avoiding drawing attention to their weaknesses. Furthermore, when multiple writers work as a team, there can be division of labor: one writer can pitch novel, big-picture, attention-grabbing ideas, and another can refine them with deep dialogue and descriptions with attention to detail.

I think Metzen is a great "idea guy". He's the [Russell T Davies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_T_Davies) of Warcraft, in that he comes up with wild, crazy, but easy to understand concepts that immediately stand out, giving the setting its unique flavor, but doesn't seem to be particularly interested in the minute details, leaving them to other writers to flesh out. He builds wide, not deep. The end result is that when he's [given free rein](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProtectionFromEditors), the stories are full of epic and memorable moments, but are puddle-deep, whereas when detail-focused writers work on the setting without him, the result is fulfilling but relatively bland, missing that special ingredient.[^davies]

Let's see what turns the setting took with him in charge of the lore.


## Legends of the Land

Unfortunately, the only version of Warcraft 2 that Blizzard sells these days is Battle.net Edition, which includes both the original game (Tides of Darkness) and the expansion (Beyond the Dark Portal). This edition has a single manual, which is [available on the Blizzard website](http://ftp.blizzard.com/pub/misc/Warcraft%202%20Battlenet%20edition.PDF) for free. Fortunately, the expansion-specific section in the manual is separate, so I'll review it later when we get to that.

Unlike Warcraft 1, the Warcraft 2 manual isn't split in two. Before delving into faction-specific lore, it begins with some shared sections: Legends of the Land, Creatures of the Land, Resources of the Land, and Places of Mystery. And a map!

The "Legends" of the Land" section features brief descriptions of six lore figures: Sir Anduin Lothar, Gul'dan, Sire Uther Lightbringer, Cho'gall, and Zuljin *[sic]*. There's some real meat here:

* We learn Lothar's first name.[^anduin] Following Llane's death, Lothar took the people of the Kingdom of Azeroth by sea into Lordaeron, and was declared Regent Lord. This writer, unlike the Warcraft 1 campaign writer, understands what a regent is. It seems, however, that the Warcraft 1 manual writer also took part in writing this manual, as both manuals are fond of using the phrase "all but killed" to mean "left on the brink of death, but alive".
* Zuljin is a "feared, rogue Troll" known for raiding elven villages. We're introduced to both elves and trolls here, in the same breath.
* Cho'gall is the first of the ogre-magi, chieftain of the Twilight's Hammer clan, and an ally of Gul'dan in the Shadow Council.
* Uther is a young apprentice of Archbishop Alonsus Faol, who was the leader of the clerics of Northshire and fled to Lordaeron, where he introduced the teachings of the clerics to the knights of Lordaeron and thus formed the paladins of the Silver Hand. That Uther is called "young" here is... interesting, considering his grey hair in Warcraft 3, only sixteen years later.
* Finally, Gul'dan is a powerful warlock and an apprentice in "the arts arcane" to the daemon Kil'jaeden. He is the mastermind behind the Horde and the Shadow Council. He wants to obtain the secrets of the Tomb of Sargeras, and the necrolytes, ogre-magi, and death knights are all his creations.

There is a lot to unpack here, so I'll say more when we get to human and orc lore.

The "Places of Mystery" section talks about:

* The Runestone at Caer Darrow, an ancient monolith erected by the elven druids and desecrated by Gul'dan and his ogres to create the ogre-magi.[^runestone]
* The [Tomb of Sargeras](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Tomb_of_Sargeras), which is "rumored"[^rumor] to contain the remains of the ancient daemonlord [Sargeras](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Sargeras) defeated by Guardian [Aegwyn](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Aegwyn) *[sic]*. Medivh, her son, promised to give away its location to Gul'dan in exchange for the destruction of Azeroth[^azeroth], but was killed before he could do so. Now Gul'dan wants to find it.
* The Portal, through which the orcs originally invaded the world, is still there and is draining the land around it, turning it into ["barren soil the color of blood"](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Blasted_Lands). This needs to be stopped before it consumes the entire world.

This is interesting. Remember that Warcraft 1 left us two mysteries: Medivh's mysterious dark powers and motivation, and the identities and role of the Shadow Council. We get some answers here. We know from the first game that it was Medivh who brought the orcs into this world. Now we know why: he wanted the Kingdom of Azeroth destroyed (for reasons yet unexplained) and struck a deal with Gul'dan, the mastermind behind the Shadow Council, who agreed to invade in return for information about the Tomb of Sargeras.

This is the first time we see the name "the Horde", rather than the plural "orcish hordes" from the first game.

{% figure [caption:"I guess all those islands were later flushed out way to the west. Must have been ocean currents."] %}
<img src="/assets/wr/wc2_map.jpg" width="500" />
{% endfigure %}

Finally, there's the map, which reveals that the entire setting of Warcraft 1 was a small patch at the south of a yet-unnamed continent. There are a lot more nations to the north, as well as a few islands strewn across the sea, which makes sense for a game with a heavy focus on naval combat. The setting has been tailored to fit the story, as much of the campaign takes place in that giant gulf south of Lordaeron.[^baradin_bay] This makes sense; there's a reason *[One Piece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece)* doesn't take place on a giant supercontinent.

It seems we're following the ending where the orcs won, but where the Lothar and Medivh missions of the human campaign still happened. Let's dive into follow-up lore, starting with...


## The Human Section

As before, we open with a tale by an unreliable narrator. This time it's Aegwyn, Medivh's mother.

This is a *huge* expansion on Warcraft 1 lore. We get the names of both Medivh's mother and [father](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Nielas_Aran), as well as the reason why Aegwyn (with one N for now) gave birth to him in the first place. She was the Guardian of the Order of Tirisfal, appointed to protect the world from the mysteries of the Great Dark Beyond[^great_dark] and the horrors of the Twisting Nether. She decided to bear a child to whom she could pass her powers.

However, unprepared to deal with his PHENOMENAL COSMIC POWER, Medivh fell into a coma, in which he lay for six years. During that time, his soul was forever twisted by the evil of the Twisting Nether. Hungering for more power, he turned to necromancy, struck deals with daemons, and eventually, discovering the orcs and their homeworld, struck the aforementioned deal with Gul'dan. We get a reason why Medivh wanted the Kingdom of Azeroth gone: it was the only thing that threatened his rise to power.

Medivh opened "the first of his unnatural Portals" (implying there were more?!) to let the orcs into Azeroth. What follows is a brief recap of the events of Warcraft 1. Medivh is killed, but the orcs are nonetheless victorious, sacking Stormwind Keep and killing King Llane, but Lothar leads the survivors across the sea, setting the stage for...


### The Alliance of Lordaeron

{% figure [caption:"So that's the inspiration for the derpy elves in the Warcraft movie!"] %}
![WC2 Alliance council](/assets/wr/wc2_alliance_council.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Alarmed by the orc threat, King Terenas of Lordaeron gathers "a council of delegates from each of the seven kingdoms under his rule". It's strange that all seven kingdoms are described as being under his rule when it's immediately contradicted by the following text. Even the dwarves of Khaz Modan and the elves of Quel'thalas *[sic]* came in, with the three races looking past their old grudges.

This is big. We learn that this world is inhabited by more races than just humans, and that there are many kingdoms across it. This immediately changes the setting from a proto-Diablo to something more akin to Dungeons & Dragons.

Meet the seven kingdoms![^seven_kingdoms]

* [Azeroth](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Stormwind_(kingdom)). Blue, led by Regent Lord Anduin Lothar. Their defining trait is being refugees seeking to retake their homeland.[^stormwind]
* [Lordaeron](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Lordaeron_(kingdom)). White, led by King Terenas. Their defining trait is religion.
* [Stromgarde](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Stromgarde_(kingdom)). Red, led by Thoras Trollbane. Their defining trait is martial prowess from a long history of war with the trolls.
* [Kul Tiras](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Kul_Tiras_(kingdom)). Green, led by Lord Admiral Daelin Proudmoore. Their defining trait is their navy, both merchant ships and warships.
* [Gilneas](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Gilneas_(kingdom)). Black, led by Genn Greymane.[^greymane] Their defining trait is not joining the Alliance.
* [Dalaran](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Dalaran_(kingdom)). Violet, led by the Kirin Tor (no named characters). Their defining trait is magic power and knowledge.
* [Alterac](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Alterac_(kingdom)). Orange, led by Lord Perenolde. As the weakest of the human kingdom, their defining trait is fear of being steamrolled by the Horde.

And lifted straight from D&D, you get your typical forest-dwelling elves, subterranean dwarves, and steampunk inventor gnomes. None of them have any named characters.

The unit roster has undergone some changes. The archers are now elves, the mages come from the Violet Citadel of Dalaran (but oddly, they're also described as one-students of the Conjurers from the first game). Instead of clerics, we have paladins, who in this game are upgraded knights. The dwarves contributed demolition squads and gryphon riders, and the gnomes built flying machines.

Finally, there are the naval units, most which require an additional, third resource: oil. These are the oil tanker, which is used to build oil platform; the elven destroyer, transport, battleship, and gnomish submarine. We have a weird mixture of sailing ships and more technological ones, and there's no explanation what the sailing ships need oil for.

There's not much to say about the buildings, except that lumber mills are now constructed by the elves (who are motivated by "seeking insight into the mysteries of the great Ironwood trees of Northeron[^northeron]"), and churches still have crosses on them, but unlike in Warcraft 1, there is no mention of God. It's unclear whom or what the human religion actually worships.

This is *big*. We've jumped from a pseudo-medieval setting into one where sword and sorcery coexist with steampunk technology. There are no firearms yet, but foundries, oil refineries, flying machines and submarines are already in. Next time someone says WoW ruined Warcraft by introducing technology, you can remind them that technology has been part of the setting almost from the start. The difference is one of degrees, of course; this is at best Industrial Revolution era tech, not spaceships and laser guns.


## The Orc Section

The narration here is done by Gul'dan, Chieftain of the Stormreaver Clan and Initiate of the Seventh Circle of the Shadow Council.






[^good_endings]: There are, of course, exceptions; of particular interest is the approach of [XCOM 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XCOM_2), which, not wanting to invalidate the triumphant ending of the first game, continues the story from the *game over state*, where the aliens won and took over the world.

[^bad_guys]: Recall that in the story of Warcraft 1, the orcs were basically a living demonic plague. You could, if you wanted, make a subversive story about how they were unfortunate victims of their nature, 

[^first_ones]: For example, everything involving the First Ones and Zereths.

[^davies]: The same, in my opinion, is true of Russell T Davies.

[^anduin]: Warcraft 2 lifted quite a few things straight from *The Lord of the Rings*, but the name [Anduin](https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Anduin) ("long river" in Sindarin) is by far the most blatant example.

[^runestone]: This particular bit of lore has since been [retconned beyond all recognition](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Ban%27dinoriel).

[^rumor]: The writer of the Warcraft 2 manual liked the word "rumor". All rumors mentioned in the manual are completely correct, at least in the light of lore as it existed back then.

[^azeroth]: The kingdom, not the world. Remember, the world is still nameless.

[^baradin_bay]: Known in modern lore as [Baradin Bay](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Baradin_Bay). Later lore retconned all those islands to be west of the continent.

[^great_dark]: Presumably she doesn't mean the vacuum of space. It seems that "the Great Dark Beyond" here is meant to be some kind of counterpart to D&D's Astral Plane, not physical outer space.

[^seven_kingdoms]: They're most probably *not* a reference to the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros in *A Song of Ice and Fire*, whose first novel wasn't even published until the following year.

[^stormwind]: This will be important later.

[^greymane]: This is an amusing *unintentional* example of a [prophetic name](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PropheticNames). It will be a long time until worgen will be invented, let alone be associated with Gilneas.

[^northeron]: Not much is known about Northeron except that it's one of the dwarven lands, but this implies it's next to the elven lands. It was probably meant to be **North**ern Lorda**eron** before the Cataclysm developers said it was part of the Twilight Highlands. This is supported by [this early WoW map sketch](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/File:Eastern_Kingdoms_concept_sketch.jpg).
