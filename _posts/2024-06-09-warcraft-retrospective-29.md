Let's catch a break from the fast-paced storytelling of Reign of Chaos, take a step back, and look at the big picture. 

This story is not particularly novel or groundbreaking, not even by video game standards. If we judged games solely by the quality of writing and depth of characterization, I could easily name some games [even from the same year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_of_Might_and_Magic_IV) that beat this game fair and square. Where Warcraft 3 excelled was *presentation*, and that was made this story and these characters so memorable and evocative.

Yes, Heroes 4 has six campaigns with a novel-length story *each*, containing good twists and turns. But that storytelling is done through text throughout the missions and is almost completely divorced from the gameplay.

The strategy genre, whether real-time or turn-based, is inherently tricky to use as a storytelling medium because of the heavily abstracted gameplay. (Imagine trying to tell a character-driven story through a [Civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(series)) campaign!) It's hard to make immersive cutscenes on a map where units and heroes are huge and buildings and trees are tiny.

And yet Warcraft 3 succeeded.

It succeeded by making its presentation as vivid and visceral as possible. Everything in this game, from units to buildings to the user interface, was crafted to give the impression of weight, of physicality. Menus are shaped like physical panels and slide down and up on chains that make a sound. The colors are bright and vibrant, helping compensate for the limitations of 2002's 3D graphics. The visuals are all exaggerated, larger than life, 
with bulky armor designs and trees that shake when hit by a peasant's axe. Powerful AoE abilities like Earthquake shake the screen. And the visual designs of units and buildings support the game feel in such a way that you rarely even need to look at the numbers: generally, the bigger and more menacing a creature looks, the more dangerous it is.

And the story is told through in-engine cutscenes and voice lines spoken through the missions that are short, snappy, and are neither too simplistic nor dumping an entire wiki's worth of exposition on the poor player, providing *just* enough detail to understand the plot and the character motivations in their proper context.

Warcraft 3 is a comic book in game form. By the nature of its medium, a comic book allows less nuance than a novel and doesn't have the cinematic fluidity of a movie, so it has to compensate through bright colors, bold character designs and exaggerated body language, as well as the ability to blend visuals and text together and have them support each other.

This is not that surprising, considering Chris Metzen is (or was) a [big fan of comic books](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/17oetod/chris_metzen_origin_story/) and cited them as one of the major inspirations for the Warcraft setting; for example, Sargeras was [inspired](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Sargeras#Notes_and_trivia) by the fire giant [Surtur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surtur_(character)) from Marvel's *Thor*, one of Metzen's favorite comic book franchises.

Though we might sneer at Blizzard's shallow characters now, this kind of immersive storytelling that makes as many players as possible to care about at least the broad strokes of the story and characters takes finesse, attention to detail, and many iterations of draft scripts and storyboards, and is very, very easy to get wrong. As an example of how an imitation of the Warcraft 3 approach can easily go wrong, consider Heroes of Might and Magic 5.[^homm5]

The first mission begins with a six-minute-long cutscene, the first two minutes of which are a recreation of an in-game tactical battle between two no-name heroes that are never seen or mentioned again. Then we sit through four minutes of exposition with shoddy camerawork, where the characters sit on their horses making weird hand gestures and casting random spells. The mouths of their world models don't move, and since there are no animated portraits like in Warcraft 3, there is nothing to convey the idea that they're actually *speaking* rather than somehow conversing telepathically. We hear random exposition about faraway lands that doesn't matter to *this* mission in particular, all the while the player is shouting ["get on with it already!"](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlowPacedBeginning)

The unit models don't support the story either. [The queen](https://mightandmagic.fandom.com/wiki/Isabel), at this point in the story, is supposed to be a noncombatant who was evacuated to the countryside for her own safety, and who only goes to war herself after learning that her husband is taking losses at the front --- yet in the cutscene, before she's told any of this, she is already mounted, fully armored, and holding a sword.

The best story in the world could be ruined by such clunky presentation. And unfortunately, Heroes 5's story isn't exactly brilliant either, to the point that there's an [abridged script website](http://heroesinanutshell.blogspot.com/p/contents.html) mocking it. It broadly copies Warcraft 3's setup of "the demons are behind everything and everyone unites unites against them after you play each faction in order", but fumbles it. The characters make nonsensical decisions, fall for obvious traps and obviously evil advisors, and use powers that are incredibly convenient at that one moment yet are not used or mentioned again.

The gameplay doesn't support this story either. Because of how the stack mechanics in this game work, the heroes field enormous armies, yet their size is never acknowledged in-story. We spend two missions on pure padding, where the anti-hero protagonist, a former demon cultist on the run, conquers almost the entire elven kindgom because *he needed a freaking ship*, and as soon as he boards that ship, he leaves them alone. In the process he recruits these elves (because that's how the gameplay works) to fight their own brethren with a unit they're not yet supposed to have story-wise. Later in the story, after we switch to playing the elves, we get a whole mission solely dedicated to unlocking that unit. Sigh.

Not only that, but this is a turn-based strategy game where, quiet often, in-game days pass with nothing happening from your perspective, with your actions that day being limited to moving your hero a bit farther through the map and clicking the "end turn" button. This makes fast-paced storytelling impossible and negates any sense of urgency instilled by the cutscenes.

Warcraft 3, in contrast, strikes a very delicate balance.

On one hand, it [integrates the gameplay and the story](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfGameplayAndStoryIntegration) as closely as possible in an RTS game, using a variety of map scripts and cinematography tricks to achieve this. On the other hands, it *almost* never forces silly gameplay tropes that undermine the seriousness of the story, and *almost* never treats gameplay abstractions as literally true.[^abstractions]

But also, I think one of the things to which Warcraft 3 owes its enduring popularity is one of its most important characters. And I'm not talking about Arthas, Thrall, or Illidan, but rather the world itself.

## What's Next?

Playing a Blizzard RTS followed immediately by its expansion is a weird experience. The original Starcraft ended with a protoss campaign, and then its expansion, Brood War, *opened* with a protoss campaign, which meant that if you were playing the original game and the expansion together, you'd be stuck with the protoss for eighteen missions in a row.

Warcraft 3 follows the same pattern, which was one of the reasons I decided to write an intermission post before heading into its expansion, The Frozen Throne.

Next up: more night elves! We'll address one of the loose threads of Reign of Chaos by finding out what happened to Illidan. The guilty will suffer! (Eventually.)


[^homm5]: Now, gameplay-wise 5 is easily one of my two favorite games in the HOMM series, along with 4, but *oh boy* is the story just [unintentionally hilarious in a bad way](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm).

[^abstractions]: With just a few exceptions. Looking at you, Daughters of the Moon.
