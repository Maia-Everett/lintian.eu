![The Invasion of Kalimdor](/assets/wr/20240429235232_1.jpg)

While in Lordaeron, mortals tremble and despair as doom has come to this world, Thrall and his orcs and recently-joined Darkspear trolls continue to sail west to Kalimdor, blissfully unaware of the fate of the land they left --- for now.


## Landfall

{% figure [caption:"Look out, new world, here we come, brave, intrepid and then some!"] %}
![Landfall](/assets/wr/20240429235239_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

In contrast to the hectic and dramatic presentation of the undead campaign finale, the orc campaign starts slow and quiet. The camera pans across the gulf towards a... burning ship. Of course.

{% figure [caption:"I love the way we laaaaand!"] %}
![Landfall](/assets/wr/20240429235252_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

The orcs have landed in some kind of tropical savannah. Thrall isn't even sure that this is Kalimdor, but his grunt assures him that this must be it. The other ships are missing, and Grom Hellscream's fate concerns Thrall in particular. Time to look around.

We start with two grunts and two troll headhunters, and in classic Reign of Chaos, which only includes the first two missions of the prologue campaign, it's not explained where the trolls came from. They're just... there, somehow. Their story is only told in full in the Warcraft 3 demo, in the [bonus prologue missions](https://lintian.eu/2024/03/13/warcraft-retrospective-20/) I previously covered. Thankfully, these missions are included in Reforged.

{% figure [caption:"The second main quest: lead them to their destiny."] %}
![Landfall](/assets/wr/20240429235350_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

All that effort spent on leveling and gearing Thrall in the prologue campaign --- even in the first two missions that are included in retail Reign of Chaos --- is gone. He's back at level 1 and his inventory consists of a single Scroll of Healing. Presumably the campaign designers decided not to punish people for skipping the prologue campaign and not create an impression that it's mandatory. It doesn't really matter much, since we're going to find the same or better loot in this campaign.

At release, this mission excited me. Kalimdor was a complete unknown, and I was entirely unspoiled about its geography and inhabitants. It really felt like I was on a journey of discovery in a whole new world, and I was as surprised by the subsequent developments as Thrall was. It's still one of my favorite exploration missions in the game.

As I go out exploring, the first thing I notice is that this campaign actually forces me to be careful. Unlike Arthas and... er... Arthas, Thrall doesn't have any healing spells. This means that the big, brutal orcs are, paradoxically, more vulnerable than the humans and undead were in their starting missions. I have to be careful with micromanagement, rotating units being attacked and moving away wounded ones so they can be healed later.

At least there's no shortage of healing items on this map. There are two stacks of healing wards, of three each. I'll spend one stack in this mission and leave the other one for the next mission, which is also scarce on healing and includes the additional component of time pressure.

We fight our way along the coast, fighting murlocs and, weirdly, bronze dragon whelps. Then we come across a burning outpost with the ground littered with skeletons.

{% figure [caption:"Hey, at least it's fertile!"] %}
![Landfall](/assets/wr/20240505162814_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Soon enough, we witness three [horse-men](warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Centaur) fight and kill some kind of large... [bull-man](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Tauren)?

{% figure [caption:"The battle is scripted in such a way that you can't save any of the bull-men. Except in Reforged, where you can save them, but they have no dialogue and don't acknowledge you in any way. Reforged: a cacophony of half-measures!"] %}
![Landfall](/assets/wr/20240505162906_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

We also fight the [quillboar](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Quilboar) *[sic]*, a race of boar-porcupine-people.[^boarqpines]

{% figure [caption:"At least they're prettier than the humans, says the grunt."] %}
![Landfall](/assets/wr/20240505163008_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

So far, all the natives has been attacking us on sight. This includes [harpies](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Harpy), flying half-woman-half-birds, and [thunder lizards](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Thunder_lizard), massive stegosaur-like animals that stomp the ground and shoot lightning.

This finally changes when Thrall comes upon another group of stranded orcs and trolls. He begins asking them whether they've seen any sign of Grom, but their conversation is unexpectedly interrupted when a group of bull-men breaks through the nearby trees.

{% figure [caption:"Is he bent like that under the weight of the giant totem on his back?"] %}
![Landfall](/assets/wr/20240505164547_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Warcraft 3 is good at giving you an *illusion* of freedom, and this mission is no exception. On the surface, it seems like you're free to go anywhere, but in fact this map is carefully designed so that you'll always go past the major setpieces and end up here.

The leader of these bull-men is the elderly but vigorous chief [Cairne Bloodhoof](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Cairne_Bloodhoof), and his people are the [tauren](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Tauren). Cairne is intrigued by the orcs fighting with both savagery and valor, and has a rather funny (and insightful) reaction to Thrall seeking his destiny:

{% figure [caption:"Thrall's henchmen are so disinterested in this conversation that they're just looking away."] %}
![Landfall](/assets/wr/20240505164558_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Thrall immediately latches to the idea of finding this Oracle. When Cairne learns that there's an army of horse-men --- centaurs --- marching north, he is immediately alarmed and storms off with his tauren to defend his village. And here, I hate to say it, the mission creates a fake sense of urgency.

The dialogue and the quest description makes it look like you need to follow Cairne right away and protect it from harm. However, there's still a pretty large unexplored chunk of the map that contains some of the best loot in this mission. What the game *doesn't* tell you is that Cairne will be safe as long as you don't trigger the final event by following him. This fits with Warcraft 3's overall philosophy of encouraging exploration and not punishing the player for it. And indeed, there's a guarded Health Stone on the newly-unlocked portion of the map, as well as a large village of murlocs on the coast. The murlocs fight dirty, using poisons and nets, but the reward --- a Periapt of Vitality --- is well worth it.

{% figure [caption:"The tauren are considered AI allies, so you see where they went. Don't worry --- they'll patiently wait for you to clear the map."] %}
![Landfall](/assets/wr/20240505164907_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

As soon as Thrall approaches Cairne at the end of the map, the centaurs attack, and you have to survive four waves of them, ending with a Centaur Champion. Once they're repelled, Cairne says that the centaur drove off all the game in this region, so the tauren will have to migrate north, to the verdant grasslands of [Mulgore](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Mulgore). Thrall offers to escort him on his march in exchange for being told more about the Oracle, and Cairne welcomes the orcs along.


## The Long March

{% figure [caption:"Followed by the Short April."] %}
![The Long March](/assets/wr/20240505165332_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Thrall displays a surprising knowledge of the world he never saw.

{% figure [caption:"Before the retcons, anyway."] %}
![The Long March](/assets/wr/20240505165339_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

I mean, it's possible that Grom or other orcs from Draenor described to him what their world was like before the warlocks turned it into the barely-hospitable wasteland we saw in Beyond the Dark Portal. But still.

The tauren revere someone called the [Earth Mother](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Earth_Mother), and Cairne likes a life of freely roaming the plains. Thrall, on the other hand, wants the orcs to have a land they can call their own.

This is one long escort mission. The tauren have brought along four [kodo beasts](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Kodo) --- horned dinosaur-like pack animals --- and at least two of them must survive until the end. There are three oases (actually Fountains of Health) to visit along the way, and other than them, sources of healing continue to be very scarce, so you once again have to be careful with your limited units.

{% figure [caption:"I have no idea what that spell effect is."] %}
![The Long March](/assets/wr/20240505183204_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Story-wise, very little of importance happens in this mission, and it ends up being kind of a drag. (We do learn that Grom Hellscream is alive and has sent scouts to find Thrall.) Gameplay-wise, its purpose is to teach you some micromanagement by putting you in a situation where you have to conserve your units.

In theory, this mission is a series of trade-offs. You can be purely defensive, following the main road and protecting the caravan from periodically spawning centaur raiders, or you can take forays into side paths and battle creeps in the hope of finding some good loot. Either way, as soon as you're away from the caravan, you can expect to hear...

{% figure [caption:"These three headhunters graduated from the [Imperial Stormtrooper Marksmanship Academy](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ImperialStormtrooperMarksmanshipAcademy)."] %}
![The Long March](/assets/wr/20240505183530_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

And you can expect Cairne to repeat this line again. And again. And *again*.

In practice, this is a rare mission that actually *punishes* you for exploration most of the time, as most of the loot here is really underwhelming. Some of the optional encounters drop *nothing*, others drop a potion or scroll that only just about covers the HP and mana you expended to defeat them in the first place, some drop items that give +1 strength or intelligence and aren't even worth picking up considering you only have six inventory slots, and only three items in the entire mission are worth picking, one of which comes from an encounter right along the main road, and two from a hard optional boss fight.

In my playthrough I went into the other extreme, playing it too safe and thus missing a neat Mantle of Intelligence +3 from a group of harpies near the main road that I took care to avoid. Ah well. Thrall will find better items later anyway.

The final stretch, between the second and third oasis, goes past a series of towers, but thankfully, we get catapults to knock them down. Catapults that... Grom's Warsong clan just brought us all the way here across half the Barrens, apparently.

{% figure [caption:"Despite being built by centaurs, these towers use the Horde tower model."] %}
![The Long March](/assets/wr/20240505184848_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

After we reach the last oasis, the ending cutscene plays. The caravan has reached Mulgore, but an overwhelming wave of centaurs advances through the nearby mountain pass. In response, Cairne stomps the ground so hard that it causes a cave-in, blocking the exit.

{% figure [caption:"Curses! We're foiled by a head-high ramp we can just run over!"] %}
![The Long March](/assets/wr/20240505185116_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

And... this is where, for the first time in my entire playthrough, I saw a Warcraft 3 cutscene actually bug out. Cairne started telling Thrall what the Oracle is, but one centaur got through the rubble, and Cairne interrupted his exposition for his catchphrase that he's only supposed to say during the actual mission.

{% figure [caption:"That's one suicidal centaur."] %}
![The Long March](/assets/wr/wc3_hold_your_formations.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Cairne then engaged that centaur alongside his tauren, in a cutscene, while continuing to talk.

{% figure [caption:"&ldquo;Cairne, we're sort of in the middle of talking about the Oracle...&rdquo; — &ldquo;I can multitask!&rdquo;"] %}
![The Long March](/assets/wr/20240505185148_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

And there we go. The orcs and the tauren part ways for now, and Thrall sets out for his next destination: Stonetalon Peak, where the Oracle will hopefully give him the answers he seeks.

While this mission is fairly light on plot developments --- its only significance is Thrall learning the location of the Oracle, which could easily be moved to the end of the previous mission --- it helps introduce the new setting and set the pacing. It establishes the scope and breadth of Kalimdor and shows that Thrall took some time to traverse it while back in the east, the Burning Legion was engaged in...


## The Wreckage of Lordaeron

{% figure [caption:"They laughed at the Prophet. They called him mad. But who's saying &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; now?"] %}
![The Wreckage of Lordaeron](/assets/wr/20240505185229_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

We get another interlude. While the orcs are busy exploring this mysterious continent and gaining new allies, back in Lordaeron, things aren't so rosy. The demons are mercilessly slaughtering whole human villages.

{% figure [caption:"Arthas burned down human settlements before it was mainstream."] %}
![The Wreckage of Lordaeron](/assets/wr/20240505185304_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

This large demon that Tichondrius is talking to is [Mannoroth](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Mannoroth), a giant [four-legged centauroid... thing](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Pit_lord). I like how demon designs from Warcraft 3 onwards are creative and varied instead of conventional "human with horns and hooves"[^goatee] designs of different sizes.

{% figure [caption:"That infernal in the background is just chilling around."] %}
![The Wreckage of Lordaeron](/assets/wr/20240505185309_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

It's incredible how much story significance they managed to pack into a relatively short cutscene --- and in a natural way, at that. First of all, it re-establishes a sense of urgency and tension. After two relatively quiet and low-stakes "Thrall's tropical safari" missions, we get reminded that the Burning Legion is still a looming threat --- and they aren't going to stop at Lordaeron. Their ultimate goal is still to destroy the whole world, though how they're planning to achieve it is yet unclear.

This cutscene also establishes an important fact about the backstory: Mannoroth considers the orcs to be "his", and he is considered responsible for their previous failure to conquer this world. After learning that they escaped to Kalimdor[^agents], he wants to follow and reclaim them. Suddenly, Archimonde appears and reminds both who's the boss here.

{% figure [caption:"That infernal in the background is just chilling around."] %}
![The Wreckage of Lordaeron](/assets/wr/20240505185403_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

The final thing this cutscene establishes is the [brains-and-brawn](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainsAndBrawn) duo of Tichondrius and Mannoroth. Tichondrius is the schemer, playing the long game and making plans. Mannoroth, on the other hand, is not particularly bright, and is [the muscle](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy). The two also have little love for each other yet [have to work together](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethClenchedTeamwork) for the time being.

In the next mission, things will begin to heat up for the Horde.


## Cry of the Warsong

{% figure [caption:"So it takes a total of seven days to cross the Barrens on foot, got it!"] %}
![Cry of the Warsong](/assets/wr/20240505185420_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

By this point, the player is probably itching to build a base and maybe raze some enemy ones. One of Thrall's grunts echoes this sentiment.

{% figure [caption:"Poor Thrall. He's an idealistic young leader stuck leading a nation of [fantasy Klingons](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ProudWarriorRaceGuy)."] %}
![Cry of the Warsong](/assets/wr/20240505185433_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Soon, the opportunity presents itself:

{% figure [caption:"The archmage says the orcs have followed them here, so yes, they're refugees too."] %}
![Cry of the Warsong](/assets/wr/20240505185501_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

We gain control, help Grom destroy this human undead base, and build our own on its ruins, all the while Grom stays at his fully built base nearby. He says that the humans got here the same way the orcs did, and "a frail girl named [Proudmoore](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Jaina_Proudmoore)" leads them.

Scouts bring Thrall a report, and he formulates a plan.

{% figure [caption:"You spotted something on the other side of the map? Couldn't you also reveal the map for me?"] %}
![Cry of the Warsong](/assets/wr/20240506132923_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

There's a goblin laboratory that will bring Thrall to Stonetalon Peak quickly, and he hopes to hire some zeppelins without causing much fuss. Then... basically, this happens.

> **Thrall:** Right, here's the plan. We'll run through, get to the laboratory, secure the zeppelins, then fly them to Stonetalon Peak. Do not engage any of the humans. Hopefully we can do this with as few casualties as possible--  
> **Grom:** Alright chums, time's up, let's do this. [GROOOOOOM HELLSCREEEEEEEEEAM!](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Leeroy_Jenkins_(video))  
> **Thrall:** Oh spirits, he just ran in, save him!

That's right --- not only does Grom attack the humans in direct disregard of Thrall's order, but he does it in the stupidest way possible. He takes, like, five grunts with him while leaving behind the rest of his army (including raiders, who would be very good at razing buildings), then charges across the map to one of the human bases at random. After he invariably dies if attacking on his own, the humans get alerted and counterattack, except they attack *you*. It's like playing multiplayer with a blockhead ally with no comprehension of unit specialization or basic tactics.

Because of this, the optimal thing to do is to join Grom on his assaults and take out the human bases together, one by one. You still have to invest in base defense just in case one of the other human bases attacks you in the meantime.

{% figure [caption:"That paladin will soon be paladout."] %}
![Cry of the Warsong](/assets/wr/20240506134205_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Thankfully, the map designers realized that you might want to explore the map at your own pace without Grom forcing your hand. Once all the humans are gone, Grom is content to sit at his base for the remainder of the mission, and for once, destroying all enemy bases doesn't actually end the mission, as we still have to hire the zeppelins and bring them back to our base. This gives the player the opportunity to kill the remaining creeps and take their stuff. In particular, these folks are worth a visit:

{% figure [caption:"What kind of creatures left these giant skulls? They're much larger than the owlbears' heads!"] %}
![Cry of the Warsong](/assets/wr/20240506140947_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

These [owlbears](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Wildkin), which drop some really nice Claws of Attack +9, are, as their name implies, part owl, part bear... [and part stag, which handily avoids potential lawsuits](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Angry_Egg). Between centaurs, harpies, tauren (minotaurs), and now these, Kalimdor sometimes really feels like a habitat for all those D&D creatures that Blizzard wanted to introduce into Warcraft as part of its ongoing retool into an adventure setting, but that didn't fit thematically into the old world.

The path to the goblin laboratory is guarded by more centaurs and harpies --- nothing to difficult. In theory, it's possible to complete the main quest without destroying the humans, but the path is blocked by one of the human bases, so you'll have to either level at least that one, or run your army through it, probably taking large casualties along the way. There's also no advantage in doing so, since Warcraft 3 never remembers or acknowledges the player's moral choices across missions.

Interestingly, early on, the developers did play with the possibility of moral choices. The idea was that if the player completed this mission without killing humans or stopped Grom from attacking them, there [could be benefits later](https://youtube.com/watch?v=yUTNP5kzSrs). The same was true of the next mission, which once again pits you against an enemy that isn't your primary objective.

While that concept didn't materialize, Reforged did make a nod to the abandoned idea. When patch 1.33 [updated all the campaigns](https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/1-33-campaign-balance-update.340191/)[^reforged], it added a new path allowing the player to bypass the human bases entirely. Like all other campaign changes, this one was reverted a year later in patch 1.36.1.

Thanks for nothing, Reforged. Again.

Once the zeppelins are brought back to the base, Thrall confronts Grom, who says a true warrior would have simply taken the pass from the humans. Thrall lashes out on him for disobeying a direct order, and then...

{% figure [caption:"Foreshadowing!"] %}
![Cry of the Warsong](/assets/wr/20240506142113_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Thrall decides he can't afford the liability that Grom represents, and punishes him by [reassigning him to a menial task](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ReassignedToAntarctica) --- building a settlement at the northern forest.

I'm sure this will end well and not in any way backfire.


## The Spirits of Ashenvale

## Next Up...

Next up, Grom's battle against the night elves sees two unexpected interventions from two completely different giant centaur-like people, and Grom rediscovers his long-forgotten favorite color.
