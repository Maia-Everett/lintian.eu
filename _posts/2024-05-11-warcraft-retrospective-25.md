![The Invasion of Kalimdor](/assets/wr/20240429235232_1.jpg)

While in Lordaeron, mortals tremble and despair as doom has come to this world, Thrall and his orcs and recently-joined Darkspear trolls continue to sail west to Kalimdor, blissfully unaware of the fate of the land they left --- for now.


## Landfall

In contrast to the hectic and dramatic presentation of the undead campaign finale, the orc campaign starts slow and quiet. The camera pans across the gulf towards a... burning ship. Of course.

The orcs have landed in some kind of tropical savannah. Thrall isn't even sure that this is Kalimdor, but his grunt assures him that this must be it. The other ships are missing, and Grom Hellscream's fate concerns Thrall in particular. Time to look around.

We start with two grunts and two troll headhunters, and in classic Reign of Chaos, which only includes the first two missions of the prologue campaign, it's not explained where the trolls came from. They're just... there, somehow. Their story is only told in full in the Warcraft 3 demo, in the [bonus prologue missions](https://lintian.eu/2024/03/13/warcraft-retrospective-20/) I previously covered. Thankfully, these missions are included in Reforged.

All that effort spent on leveling and gearing Thrall in the prologue campaign --- even in the first two missions that are included in retail Reign of Chaos --- is gone. He's back at level 1 and his inventory consists of a single Scroll of Healing. Presumably the campaign designers decided not to punish people for skipping the prologue campaign and not create an impression that it's mandatory. It doesn't really matter much, since we're going to find the same or better loot in this campaign.

At release, this mission excited me. Kalimdor was a complete unknown, and I was entirely unspoiled about its geography and inhabitants. It really felt like I was on a journey of discovery in a whole new world, and I was as surprised by the subsequent developments as Thrall was. It's still one of my favorite exploration missions in the game.

As I go out exploring, the first thing I notice is that this campaign actually forces me to be careful. Unlike Arthas and... er... Arthas, Thrall doesn't have any healing spells. This means that the big, brutal orcs are, paradoxically, more vulnerable than the humans and undead were in their starting missions. I have to be careful with micromanagement, rotating units being attacked and moving away wounded ones so they can be healed later.

At least there's no shortage of healing items on this map. There are two stacks of healing wards, of three each. I'll spend one stack in this mission and leave the other one for the next mission, which is also scarce on healing and includes the additional component of time pressure.

We fight our way along the coast, fighting murlocs and, weirdly, bronze dragon whelps. Then we come across a burning outpost with the ground littered with skeletons.

Soon enough, we witness three [horse-men](warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Centaur) fight and kill some kind of large... [bull-man](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Tauren)?

{% figure [caption:"The battle is scripted in such a way that you can't save any of the bull-men. Except in Reforged, where you can save them, but they have no dialogue and don't acknowledge you in any way. Reforged: a cacophony of half-measures!"] %}
![Landfall](/assets/wr/20240505162906_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

We also fight the quillboar *[sic]*, a race of boar-porcupine-people.[^boarqpines]

{% figure [caption:"At least they're prettier than the humans, says the grunt."] %}

So far, all the natives has been attacking us on sight. This includes [harpies](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Harpy), flying half-woman-half-birds, and [thunder lizards](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Thunder_lizard), massive stegosaur-like animals that stomp the ground and shoot lightning.

This finally changes when Thrall comes upon another group of stranded orcs and trolls. He begins asking them whether they've seen any sign of Grom, but their conversation is unexpectedly interrupted when a group of bull-men breaks through the nearby trees.

Warcraft 3 is good at giving you an *illusion* of freedom, and this mission is no exception. On the surface, it seems like you're free to go anywhere, but in fact this map is carefully designed so that you'll always go past the major setpieces and end up here.

The leader of these bull-men is the elderly but vigorous chief [Cairne Bloodhoof](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Cairne_Bloodhoof), and his people are the [tauren](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Tauren). Cairne is intrigued by the orcs fighting with both savagery and valor, and has a rather funny (and insightful) reaction to Thrall seeking his destiny:

{% figure [caption:"Thrall's henchmen are so disinterested in this conversation that they're just looking away."] %}
![Landfall](/assets/wr/20240505164558_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Thrall immediately latches to the idea of finding this Oracle. When Cairne learns that there's an army of horse-men --- centaurs --- marching north, he is immediately alarmed and storms off with his tauren to defend his village. And here, I hate to say it, the mission creates a fake sense of urgency.

The dialogue and the quest description makes it look like you need to follow Cairne right away and protect it from harm. However, there's still a pretty large unexplored chunk of the map that contains some of the best loot in this mission. What the game *doesn't* tell you is that Cairne will be safe as long as you don't trigger the final event by following him. This fits with Warcraft 3's overall philosophy of encouraging exploration and not punishing the player for it. And indeed, there's a guarded Health Stone on the newly-unlocked portion of the map, as well as a large village of murlocs on the coast. The murlocs fight dirty, using poisons and nets, but the reward --- a Periapt of Vitality --- is well worth it.

{% figure [caption:"The tauren are considered AI allies, so you see where they went. Don't worry --- they'll patiently wait for you to clear the map."] %}
![Landfall](/assets/wr/20240505164907_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

As soon as Thrall approaches Cairne at the end of the map, the centaurs attack, and you have to survive four waves of them, ending with a Centaur Champion. Once they're repelled, Cairne says that the centaur drove off all the game in this region, so the tauren will have to migrate north, to the verdant grasslands of [Mulgore](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Mulgore). Thrall offers to escort him on his march in exchange for being told more about the Oracle, and Cairne welcomes the orcs along.


## The Long March

Thrall displays a surprising knowledge of the world he never saw.

I mean, it's possible that Grom or other orcs from Draenor described to him what their world was like before the warlocks turned it into the barely-hospitable wasteland we saw in Beyond the Dark Portal.





## The Wreckage of Lordaeron

{% figure [caption:"They laughed at the Prophet. They called him mad. But who's now saying &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo;?"] %}

We get another interlude. While the orcs are busy exploring this mysterious continent and gaining new allies, back in Lordaeron, things aren't so rosy. The demons are mercilessly slaughtering whole human villages.

This large demon Tichondrius is talking to is [Mannoroth](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Mannoroth), a giant [four-legged centauroid... thing](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Pit_lord).

It's incredible how much story significance they managed to pack into a relatively short cutscene --- and in a natural way, at that. First of all, it re-establishes a sense of urgency and tension. After two relatively quiet and low-stakes "Thrall's tropical safari" missions, we get reminded that the Burning Legion is still a looming threat --- and they aren't going to stop at Lordaeron. Their ultimate goal is still to destroy the whole world, though how they're planning to achieve it is yet unclear.

This cutscene also establishes an important fact about the backstory: Mannoroth considers the orcs to be "his", and he is considered responsible for their previous failure to conquer this world. After learning that they escaped to Kalimdor[^agents], he wants to follow and reclaim them. Suddenly, Archimonde appears and reminds both who's the boss here.

The final thing this cutscene establishes is the [brains-and-brawn](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BrainsAndBrawn) duo of Tichondrius and Mannoroth. Tichondrius is the schemer, playing the long game and making plans. Mannoroth, on the other hand, is not particularly bright, and is [the muscle](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TheBigGuy). The two also have little love for each other yet [have to work together](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TeethClenchedTeamwork) for the time being.

In the next mission, things will begin to heat up for the Horde.

## Next Up...

Next up, Tichondrius and Mannoroth do the same thing they do every night: try to TAKE OVER THE WORLD!


[^boarqpines]: [Boar-q-pines](https://avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Boar-q-pine)?

[^agents]: Tichondrius says that his "agents" told him the orcs landed in Kalimdor. Who these agents are and how they learned this is never explained.
