Over the past month, there have been a few smaller-scope Chaos Archives updates, mostly regarding images. Here they are.

<!--more-->

1. Everywhere on the site that you can select an image from your gallery (visual editors and banners, mostly), you can select images from any character on your account, not just the current one.

2. Owners of communities and venues can now upload icons for them. The main page now displays placeholder icons if there are no custom icons.

3. Last but not least, to celebrate the release of Dawntrail, the three Archives (Chaos, Crystal, and Central) have been updated with new backgrounds and logos by Diane Riondel, aka Acrona (Eepox)!

In less exciting technical news, the server has been updated to the latest <acronym title="Long-term support">LTS</acronym> releases of the Ubuntu operating system (24.04) and MariaDB database server (11.4.2).
