The Frozen Throne redesigned all faction themes to be more upbeat and more suggestive of action, but whereas it's very obviously the case with the human, night elf, and orc faction themes[^orc], it's less so with the undead one. There are more war drums compared to the original one, but overall it's still sticking with the feel of the previous undead theme: slow, spooky, and eerie.

As for the campaign, we're going to take a one-mission break from Sylvanas's plotline and once again focus on Arthas. <!--more-->The fourth mission covers...


## The Return to Northrend

{% figure [caption:"Oh nice, Azjol-Nerub is on the map. It means we'll be going there, right?"] %}

{% endfigure %}

Arthas lands in Northrend... and is immediately attacked by elves, whom he identifies as high elves at first. Thankfully, like many other times in Warcraft 3, his enemies have the courtesy to introduce themselves.

{% figure [caption:"That portrait is so deep in the uncanny valley that it actually bends the graph. It reminds me of halflings as depicted in original D&D 5e."] %}

{% endfigure %}

Arthas's forces engage with the dragonhawk riders... and suddenly, crypt fiends appear from the ground, led by a giant nerubian.

{% figure [caption:"Less talking, more running!"] %}
![The Return to Northrend](/assets/wr/20240913232952_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

This is [Anub'arak](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Anub'arak), the last king of Azjol-Nerub, who was reanimated by the Lich King after his demise and is now fiercely loyal to him --- though, considering the nerubians were conquered by the Scourge, probably not by his own choice. As we've seen with Sylvanas, sapient undead don't seem to have their free will intact and are instead mind-controlled by the Lich King, thus explaining their loyalty.

It's actually good that this has been established. Imagine if some *other* undead group raised their enemies as undead, and [the newly risen](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Delaryn_Summermoon), despite supposedly retaining their sound minds, immediately joined the banners of those who raised them, forgetting their previous allegiances. Without mind control, it would make no sense, right? It would be even worse if, hypothetically, the writers couldn't decide if the undead raised by this other group actually were mind-controlled or not, changing their minds from scene to scene.

And logically speaking, if the Lich King was vanquished, the undead formerly bound to his will would now be free. Mindless undead, like ghouls and zombies, would roam wild, attacking everything in sight, and those who have minds of their own would get their free will back --- as it happened to Sylvanas and her banshees.

Gameplay-wise, Anub'arak is a [crypt lord](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Crypt_Lord_(Warcraft_III)), the fourth undead hero added in the expansion. The crypt lord's gameplay role can be described in one word: **tank**. He's very durable, can increase the armor of allied units, and can raise beetles from enemy units he kills, which provides his allies with a steady stream of disposable frontliners. The crypt lord is a nice addition to the undead, whose early-to-mid-game units tend to be relatively squishy. In this campaign, Anub'arak will be taking the hits a lot of the time as Arthas gets progressively weaker by losing levels.

The elves are repelled, but there's a problem: Arthas's landing site has no resources.

{% figure [caption:"We have no base and no acolytes either, but let's worry about *that* later."] %}
![The Return to Northrend](/assets/wr/20240913233059_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

We have transport ships, but the only gold mine in the vicinity is occupied by a blood elf base, and its coast is protected by patrolling ships and four towers. Charging blindly in would be suicidal, so we take ships of our own to destroy them; the frigates mop up enemy units while the battleship destroys the towers, itself staying outside of their range.

{% figure [caption:"A nice throwback to Warcraft 2."] %}
![The Return to Northrend](/assets/wr/20240913234102_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Notice that Arthas has to use ships here to cross a narrow strait. This is because, as was *clearly* established in the vanilla undead campaign, Arthas has no way to cross bodies of water on his own. He has absolutely no magical powers that would let him, say, just make an ice bridge over the strait and charge in.

{% figure [caption:"Go away, Reforged."] %}
![The Return to Northrend](/assets/wr/now_frostmourne.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Once the towers are destroyed, the rest of the base falls easily. He calls the elves pathetic, tempting fate as their leader teleports in.

{% figure [caption:"Can't they kill him where he stands?"] %}
![The Return to Northrend](/assets/wr/20240913234354_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Warcraft 3 heroes seem fond of [treating talking as a free action](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TalkingIsAFreeAction). Once in a while in cutscenes, a hero will teleport in, stand there like nothing threatens them, talk to their enemies, then teleport out. I suppose that narratively we do need the heroes to speak their minds to each other within the constraints of the RTS format, and this is a lesser evil compared to Arthas somehow being able to hear Mal'Ganis [across the entire city of Stratholme](/2024/03/24/warcraft-retrospective-22/).

For some unfathomable reason, Kael boasts to Arthas about the vast forces under Illidan's command, marching on Icecrown Citadel even now, and taunts him that he'll never make it in time to his precious Lich King. Um, Kael, maybe it would be better not to reveal your plans to the enemy, so they won't hurry to foil said plans?

"Consider this payment for Quel'Thalas... and other insults," says Kael, then teleports away. Arthas has another fit of pain.

{% figure [caption:"I knew the night was dark, but I hoped to see at least some terrors."] %}
![The Return to Northrend](/assets/wr/20240913234436_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Once he comes back to his senses, he worries that they'll never reach the glacier in time, and Anub'arak suggests a plan.

{% figure [caption:"But what about logistics? Would moving their entire army through narrow underground passes really be faster than doing so over land?"] %}
![The Return to Northrend](/assets/wr/20240913234459_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Once we regain control, we have a rudimentary base already built on the former site of the blood elf base. I immediately start developing it, constructing towers and production buildings and upgrading the necropolis. We can't build flyers in this mission, and we'll be facing powerful enemy flyers, so I invest heavily into crypt fiends. The barrels around the base are also worth knocking down for sweet loot, including gold coins and bundles of lumber.

Anub'arak gives us a side quest: there is a dragon who lives nearby, and if we slay him, we can find items in his hoard that will protect us on our march. Soon enough, the base gets attacked by Illidan's naga.

{% figure [caption:"Of course Arthas would have no idea what they are. I like how confused he is."] %}
![The Return to Northrend](/assets/wr/20240913234905_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

The dragon in question is [Sapphiron](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Sapphiron), a mighty *level 15* blue wyrm who's guarded by two level 10 blue dragons. As Arthas approaches him, they have a really funny banther:

> **Sapphiron:** You dare enter my lair? I am Sapphiron, ancient servant of Malygos the Spell-Weaver! Explain yourselves!  
> **King Arthas:** Sorry we don't have time to chat, great wyrm. We've come to murder you and steal whatever artifacts you've been hoarding over the centuries.  
> **Sapphiron:** Honesty, how refreshing. None may challenge Sapphiron and live!

I wish more quest bosses treated us this way.

Sapphiron and his guards fall to the army of crypt fiends, and Arthas raises him as an *enormous* frost wyrm with 2750 HP! He has the power to freeze enemy buildings that needs to be researched for regular frost wyrms, so he's particularly helpful against enemy towers. He can also guard our transport ships practically by himself, which comes handy considering this is a map with lots of water.

And it really is. The naga have a home field advantage, since they can just swim across deep water, but we have to take transport ships. Still, their base falls, followed by the small blood elf base to its northwest.

Our actual goal here is to defeat the guardians of the passage to Azjol-Nerub, but before I do that, I go off exploring into the southwestern corner of the map.

{% figure [caption:"&ldquo;Get into the line!&rdquo;"] %}
![The Return to Northrend](/assets/wr/20240914125734_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

We find some ice chunks, which are immediately destroyed by an earthquake, revealing a passage filled with trees. These trees are actually placed sparsely enough to be passable, and once we go through it, we're faced with a closed door... and a cutscene.

{% figure [caption:"Like many mission secrets, this one got a &ldquo;...What.&rdquo; reaction out of me."] %}
![The Return to Northrend](/assets/wr/wc3x_undead4.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

The [Penguin King](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Penguin_King) dances around in a cutscene and doesn't attack, instead offering a Ring of Protection +4. 

There is another mission secret involving a village of walrus people called [tuskarr](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Tuskarr), who have a pen with penguins, one of which is... Little Timmy. He's been a human boy, a ghoul, and now a penguin, and if you click him enough times, he explodes. However, getting to the tuskarr requires destroying a powerful blood elf base that's otherwise optional, so I didn't bother.

The passage to Azjol-Nerub is protected by a variety of creatures, including nerubians and blue [dragonspawn](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Dragonspawn) --- centauroid draconic beings --- led by a level 15 Blue Dragonspawn Lord. However, our massive army, augmented by Sapphiron, makes quick work of them.

{% figure [caption:"Sapphiron is *huge*, and his frost breath just outright one-shots weaker units."] %}
![The Return to Northrend](/assets/wr/20240914130700_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

However, this is where we have to part with our frost wyrm friend. Azjol-Nerub awaits, and he won't fit into subterranean caverns. Probably.

Leaving Arthas as he prepares to delve underground, we return to Sylvanas.


## Dreadlord's Fall

{% figure [caption:"I'm not sure why the designers split Sylvanas's missions this way, with an Arthas mission in between. Maybe they put them in order of increasing difficulty?"] %}
![Dreadlord's Fall](/assets/wr/20240914170020_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

In Starcraft's expansion, Brood War, there was [a mission](https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Betrayal_on_Korhal_(True_Colors)) where Kerrigan betrayed her allies, launching an attack when they were resting and thus gaining a few valuable minutes of crushing their bases with impunity while their forces were asleep and disorganized.

That mission concept was so nice, Blizzard did it twice. We'll be doing the same thing here.

Sylvanas is surprised to see humans at Detheroc's stronghold, and asks Varimathras who they are.

{% figure [caption:"As you say, Dethematras. Or was it Varizar?"] %}
![Dreadlord's Fall](/assets/wr/20240914170042_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Said "Garabon or Gilithos or something" is, of course, none other than Grand Marshal Garithos. Not only did our [General Failure](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GeneralFailure) needlessly alienate some of his best troops with his racism, but now he has been outright ensorcelled by a dreadlord and is fighting on the undead's side.

Instead of attacking either base head on, Sylvanas hatches a plan. Her banshees ambush two footmen returning from a patrol, and possess them.

{% figure [caption:"We serve anyone! Anyone you say! Just please don't eject our souls out of our bodies-- AAAAAA!"] %}![Dreadlord's Fall](/assets/wr/wc3x_undead5.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

The returning footmen raise the gates and are in turn attacked by their alerted comrades. Now we have eight minutes to cause as much mayhem as possible before the enemy forces awaken.

There are four enemy bases on the map: two of Garithos's and two of Detheroc's. I chose to take out Garithos first: he's a tougher hero than Detheroc, human bases are more annoying to siege at full strength, and there are two mortar teams just outside his bases that we can possess to quickly damage buildings.

{% figure [caption:"I definitely have no problem service a demon!"] %}
![Dreadlord's Fall](/assets/wr/20240914131302_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

There's not enough time to level the bases entirely, but I don't need to. It's enough to destroy the town halls and kill all peasants, so they have no resource income and can't rebuild. After that, they can upgrade the towers for all I care and sit ducks for the remainder of the mission.

I'm kind of conflicted about the premise of this mission, though.

The premise of the previous Sylvanas mission was enough of a stretch. It's nice to have the enemy use the same tactic as us for a chance --- mind control the leader of a large force and have their underlings fall in line --- but it already stretched belief that the ogres and the bandits would follow an undead abomination, and now we have an entire human army serve a dreadlord --- and *acknowledge* it in dialogue --- just because said dreadlord mind-controlled Garithos, whom nobody liked anyway? This sounds like perfect pretext to mutiny against Garithos and appoint a new leader.

<figure class="character-portrait">
<a title="Geass" href="https://codegeass.fandom.com/wiki/Geass"><img src="/assets/wr/lelouch_geass.jpg" width="300" /></a><figcaption>Sort of like this. Even the icon is a magical eye!</figcaption></figure>
Sylvanas is now level 6, and she unlocks her ultimate ability: Charm. It mind controls any enemy organic unit, ground or flying --- whereas banshees can only possess ground units --- and has only a 40-second cooldown, so Sylvanas can use it over and over again. Between Charm and banshees, we can now outright turn whole enemy armies against their masters. This mission is *fuuun*.

Once Garithos's two bases are crippled --- and the man himself goes down after putting up one hell of a fight --- I retreat very *very* quickly to my base before the timer expires.

{% figure [caption:"Those three abominations started as Detheroc's."] %}
![Dreadlord's Fall](/assets/wr/20240914132000_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

When enemy forces awaken, Detheroc counterattacks --- and throws *everything he has* against me. Seriously, he must have collected every single unit across his two bases. Once Sylvanas and her banshees return, they're in for a tough fight --- or so it seems at first, but then we turn the heaviest hitters of Detheroc's army against him and mop up the rest.

The best time to counter-counterattack is right after an enemy's failed counterattack, so that's what I do. Detheroc's first base falls easily, having almost no units to defend it. The second one puts up more of a challenge, but eventually caves in too.

{% figure [caption:"Varimathras is not a normal dreadlord. His Rain of Fire and Doom abilities actually come from a neutral hero, the pit lord. We never get to play a normal dreadlord in any campaign."] %}
![Dreadlord's Fall](/assets/wr/20240914133033_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

After that, there's the awkward mop-up phase where we have to destroy the remains of Garithos's bases, which pose no challenge: they did upgrade their towers, but all they could produce was a few measly footmen. With both Detheroc and Garithos's bases destroyed, the mission is over.

An animation shows some kind of spell effect fading from Garithos and his men. So it seems Detheroc actually had ensorcelled *the entire human army* and not just their leader?

{% figure [caption:"I feel far from good!"] %}
![Dreadlord's Fall](/assets/wr/20240914134410_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Sylvanas proposes an alliance to the Alliance.

{% figure [caption:"I see absolutely no way this can backfire."] %}
![Dreadlord's Fall](/assets/wr/20240914134427_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Of course, as she immediately confides to Varimathras once Garithos leaves, she has no intention of giving the humans their lands back. She's merely using them. Varimathras remarks that she sounds more like a dreadlord with each passing day --- to her displeasure.


## A New Power in Lordaeron

{% figure [caption:"I still can't believe that the capital city of Lordaeron is actually called [Capital City](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Capital_City)."] %}

{% endfigure %}



...But where is Kel'Thuzad? What has *he* been doing throughout all this?

We won't get the answer, which is very puzzling, because Kel'Thuzad's plotline ended abruptly in the second mission, which makes me wonder why they bothered to put him in this campaign to begin with, only to forget about him. As far as Warcraft 3 is concerned, we're done with power squabbles in Lordaeron, and we'll be returning to Arthas in the next and final third of this campaign.

Next up: dwarves and nerubians and faceless, oh my!


[^orc]: Patience. We'll get to the orcs.
