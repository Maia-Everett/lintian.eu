The Frozen Throne redesigned all faction themes to be more upbeat and more suggestive of action, but whereas it's very obviously the case with the human, night elf, and orc faction themes[^orc], it's less so with the undead one. There are more war drums compared to the original one, but overall it's still sticking with the feel of the previous undead theme: slow, spooky, and eerie.

As for the campaign, we're going to take a one-mission break from Sylvanas's plotline and once again focus on Arthas. <!--more-->The fourth mission covers...


## The Return to Northrend

## Dreadlord's Fall

## A New Power in Lordaeron

...But where is Kel'Thuzad? What has *he* been doing throughout all this?

We won't get the answer, which is very puzzling, because Kel'Thuzad's plotline ended abruptly in the second mission, which makes me wonder why they bothered to put him in this campaign to begin with, only to forget about him. As far as Warcraft 3 is concerned, we're done with power squabbles in Lordaeron, and we'll be returning to Arthas in the next and final third of this campaign.

Next up: dwarves and nerubians and faceless, oh my!


[^orc]: Patience. We'll get to the orcs.
