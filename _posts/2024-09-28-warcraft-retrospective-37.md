We have just one campaign left. Like I said, the Horde campaign in The Frozen Throne is disconnected from the three-campaign main plot. That's why it's called the "bonus campaign" in the main menu.<!--more-->


## The Founding of Durotar

{% figure [caption:"&ldquo;You kids these days. The mask isn't supposed to be [a bat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman), it's a wolf! And [a dark one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_and_Ice_(1983_film)) at that!&rdquo;"] %}

One sign that this campaign is special is the animation that plays when you select this campaign in the main menu: it shows a scroll that unwraps into a drawing of this character and his pet bear, which in turn becomes a 3D scene.

The orcs actually almost didn't feature in The Frozen Throne. The writers couldn't think of an organic way to include them in the main plot and didn't want to shoehorn them in. However, during the development of Reign of Chaos, the level designers came up with a number of ideas that didn't fit into the traditional RTS mold, and wanted to do a campaign with more RPG elements. For The Frozen Throne, level designer Tim Campbell pushed the idea for a standalone orc campaign and designed the majority of it.

Now, I'm wary of using the term "RPG" because it's so ambiguous these days. So what do I mean when I say that The Founding of Durotar is an RPG campaign rather than an RTS one?

Fr my purposes, in the context of video games specifically, an RPG is a video game where:

* the player controls a small, limited number of characters with distinct identities;
* who have numerical stats that can be improved;
* where the basic gameplay loop involves defeating enemies and completing quests...
* to improve the player characters' stats...
* so they can defeat tougher enemies and complete more challenging quests.

It's a fairly broad definition, which encompasses "traditional" RPGs like the Baldur's Gate series, but also Diablo (which has a linear plot with no roleplaying per se, and no story decisions to make) and Mass Effect 2 (where the character advancement system is really basic), and it is under this definition that I call this campaign a mini-RPG.


## To Tame a Land

{% endfigure %}

We're back in Kalimdor, in the Barrens, where all seems quiet. We zoom on our protagonist, [Rexxar](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Rexxar), who is talking to his pet bear.

{% figure [caption:"Out of loneliness, I presume."] %}
![To Tame a Land](/assets/wr/20240918205245_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

The bear is called [Misha](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Misha), which I find rather funny. To a Russian speaker, "Misha" or "Mishka" is a diminutive form of the name Mikhail and can also serve as a diminutive, term-of-endearment word for bear. The Russian dubbers thought it sounded [unintentionally funny](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Narm) and left the bear nameless.

Suddenly, he sees an orc fighting quillboars!

{% figure [caption:"The animated portraits can be goofy sometimes, but I think it adds to the game's charm."] %}
![To Tame a Land](/assets/wr/20240918205312_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

He rushes to the orc's help and chases the quillboars off, but not before the orc, Mogrin, is mortally wounded. Having failed his mission to deliver a letter to Thrall, Mogrin believes he has lost his honor, and with his dying breath, he asks Rexxar to deliver it in his stead.

So begins our mission --- and from the very start we can see that it's going to be very different from everything we played before.

{% endfigure %}

The map is *huge*, and we start in a small corner of it. We're controlling just Rexxar and Misha, who is infinitely resummonable and doesn't expire like a typical summoned creature. Because of this, Misha is an excellent tank; if he dies, we can always just resummon him.

Not that losing Rexxar is the end of the world either. This is a campaign where the player literally cannot lose: if a hero dies, they just [revive at a Resurrection Stone](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeathIsASlapOnTheWrist). You can thus retry quests and encounters forever.

All this results in a fun and relaxed experience with no time pressure whatsoever.

We move across the map, fighting through quillboars, until we reach Orgrimmar --- the new capital city of the Horde.

{% figure [caption:"A city with no civilians. But it is, after all, still under construction."] %}
![To Tame a Land](/assets/wr/20240918205655_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Rexxar heads to Thrall, who is overseeing the construction in progress.

{% figure [caption:"While still sitting on his wolf."] %}
![To Tame a Land](/assets/wr/20240918205716_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Rexxar introduces himself as the last son of the Mok'Nathal. Thrall heard of them a people who have both orc and ogre blood in their veins (thus explaining Rexxar's unusual look). He offers Rexxar his city's hospitality, prompting him to offer to earn his keep by helping with local problems.

Thrall, in turn, introduces Rexxar to [Rokhan](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Rokhan) of the Darkspear tribe, one of his finest scouts.

{% figure [caption:"Is he... scowling?"] %}
![To Tame a Land](/assets/wr/20240918205831_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Unfortunately, Rokhan gets neither characterization nor plot relevance. Rexxar is introduced as a loner who has wandered the wilds for years and has now grown tired of solitude, so he welcomes being among civilization for a change. Rokhan is... a troll, and that's basically it. He never speaks in cutscenes, letting Rexxar do all the talking, and even when the trolls come into relevance later in this mission, he still ends up being irrelevant.

In some cases it's fine if an RPG's player character is the least interesting person in the story; it might be an intentional choice on the game designers' part if the player character is customizable and they want the player to be able to project any personality they want onto their protagonist. Here, however, both Rexxar and Rokhan are specific characters with specific identities, so it's odd that the cutscene conversations only involve one of them.


## The Settler Horde

Orgrimmar is a city under construction, where peons are working tirelessly, in the middle of an untamed wild. We're in a [frontier setting](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SettlingTheFrontier): now that the orcs have discovered new lands to call home, they're going to actually live there.

I love frontier settings. The border between wilderness and civilization is prime breeding ground for all kinds of adventure stories and practically the perfect setting for an RPG, whether tabletop or a video game: the authorities exist, but their power is weak and they need the help of able-bodied independent agents for hire, like typical RPG protagonists, to keep civilization functioning and clear all those wandering monsters in the wilderness --- which, coincidentally, can contain any exciting dungeons and ancient ruins the game designers want.

In hindsight, I would say that The Founding of Durotar was the turning point when Warcraft finished its transformation [from a primarily warfare setting into a primarily adventure setting](/2024/01/20/warcraft-retrospective-11/).

As the authorities in question, the Horde, too, undergoes a metamorphosis. We've had the Monster Horde of Warcraft 1, the War Machine Horde of Warcraft 2, and the Rebel Horde of *Lord of the Clans* and early Warcraft 3; with this campaign, we're moving into a fourth identity, the **Settler Horde**.

The Settler Horde doesn't dream of conquering the other civilized peoples and has no quarrel with them. Its goal is, instead, to tame the wild, [to shape this rugged land of theirs and build a home for all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ts64p1eFqaw). This is reflected in the first three quests we pick up by running around Orgrimmar:

* [Nazgrel](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Nazgrel), the captain of the warchief's security forces, wants Rexxar to take care of harpies who have been ransacking their supply caravans for weeks.
* The shaman [Drek'thar](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Drek'thar), whom we know from *Lord of the Clans*, wants shimmerweed, a herb that grows in Thunder Ridge, to brew a potion that will aid the warriors in battle.
* Engineer [Gazlowe](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Gazlowe) has a problem with kobolds in tunnels. Let him explain this himself:

{% figure [caption:"Gazlowe's model shows two goblins, but we're interacting with only one. I assume this is because they reused the sapper model without making a unique one. This was fixed in Reforged."] %}
![To Tame a Land](/assets/wr/20240919182104_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

*Yikes*. "Rat-freaks".

Recall, if you will, that Warcraft's [innovation](/2024/01/28/warcraft-retrospective-12/) compared to D&D-style fantasy was to treat orcs (and now, by extension, goblins) as people in their own right rather than irredeemable monsters who can be killed without mercy. And now we have a goblin working for orcs apply the same treatment to *another* classic "monster race".

...What is it, Elephant in the Room?

<img width="600" src="/assets/wr/elephant_colonialism.jpg" />

I'm afraid this story does have colonialist undertones. The orcs have arrived here from beyond the sea and are wrestling this land from its native peoples, namely the centaurs, harpies, quillboars and kobolds, by lethal force. You could argue that they left the orcs no choice by refusing to negotiate and by universally attacking everyone on sight, but the truth is, we don't really have the evidence to judge either way.

Gameplay mechanics are an abstraction. Yes, when you approach the kobolds and centaurs, they attack you on sight, but is it because the orcs aren't even trying to negotiate, or because the natives are not interested in negotiations at all?

We don't know.


## The Early Quests


## Suddenly, Humans


## Evacuating the Echo Isles


## Ambushing the Ambushers


At release, the campaign actually ended here, as Blizzard ran out of time to finish the Founding of Durotar campaign before the game went gold. Only in patch 1.13, five and a half months after release, did the remaining two missions arrive: Act 2 "Old Hatreds" and the very short Act 3 "A Blaze of Glory".

Next up, we'll visit Dustwallow Marsh and Theramore Isle, and we'll find out who's behind the human attacks --- and stop them.
