Now that we're done with the Warcraft 1 orc campaign, let's look at the other side of the conflict. 

Like I said last time, the two campaigns have directly contradictory plots. They're alternate histories, not parts of a single large narrative. I've also noted that despite the storylines of both campaigns being really basic, the human campaign has more awkward writing than the orc one.I'm not sure if it's a result of having different writers or a single writer who paid less attention to these particular missions.

## The Gameplay

{% figure [caption:"In Warcraft 1, you could only construct buildings next to roads, which you built from the town hall menu. I miss this mechanic. It restricted building placement, but it actually made the bases feel like proper towns."] %}

{% endfigure %}

Like I noted, all non-caster units in this game have identical stats to their enemy counterparts, so the core mechanics involving base building, workers, and martial units are exactly the same. Unfortunately, this makes playing one campaign after the other feel like even more of a chore.

All the gameplay jank is still there. Just like orc units used the same voice lines consisted of growls and untranslated words in Orcish, here, all human units share the same voice set. There are exactly two voice lines acknowledging your orders, which are "yes" and "yes, my lord". Prepare to hear them over and over again, from mission to mission, as you micromanage your units.

The game engine can only handle two opposing sides, one of which is colored red and the other blue; it's reflected on buildings and on unit livery. In the orc campaign, your side is red, and in the human campaign, your side is blue. Each campaign also has a mission where you fight your own faction, and the enemy uses the other color. So in the human mission dealing with renegade humans, the enemy is red, and in the orc mission where you betray Blackhand, his units are inexplicably blue.

The pathfinding in this game is atrocious. Dungeon crawling missions are designed as [space-filling paths](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SpaceFillingPath), but the unit AI doesn't know how to navigate them. If you reach the end of the dungeon and then command a unit to come back to the entrance, it won't go through the winding path you've already explored and cleared. It will reach the wall that blocks a straight-line route and just stand there. You have to guide it all the way back, manually.

None of this is particularly bothersome on is own, especially considering how old this game is, but Warcraft 1 really hasn't aged well.


## The Story

{% figure [caption:"The King has sent us to you to be your personal Exposition Squad."] %}
![Team Exposition](/assets/wr/wc1_human1_intro.png)
{% endfigure %}

Like in the orc campaign, all storytelling is done through the mission briefings, with scrolling text and voice-over narration. Instead of two cartoony orcs in Lost Vikings-inspired armor, here we have a ripped warrior and a blue Gandalf knockoff sitting at a war table.[^conjurer] Neither of them is named, and neither of them is supposed to be you, since the human campaign shows your character in the ending cutscene[^cutscene], and he looks different.

The human campaign is almost a mirror image of the orc one. To wit:

* The King appoints you as Regent over a small parcel of land, and tells you to build a barracks and six farms. This is the first of the weird word choices in this story. A [regent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regent) is a temporary ruler of a monarchy appointed when the monarch is underage or is otherwise unfit to govern. Since the order comes from the King, he is clearly in charge, and by the story logic, you are more of a regional governor, or perhaps a feudal lord granted a fiefdom.[^fiefdom]
* You are tasked with defending the town of Grand Hamlet[^grand_hamlet] from invading orcs.
* You destroy the orcish outpost of Kyross that the narration says lies deep within the Swamps of Sorrow, but the 3D map actually shows it to be right next to Stormwind.

{% figure [caption:"I like the visual continuity of the human campaign map. You start in the upper-left corner, near Stormwind, and expand from there. The orc missions, in comparison, are all over the place."] %}

{% endfigure %}

* You are sent to find Sir Lothar, who went into the Dead Mines twenty months ago to search for the lost Tome of Divinity and never returned. Recently, he appeared in a vision to the Abbot of Northshire, "battered and pleading for assistance", and so you've been given warriors and healers to rescue him.

    This setup is bizarre. They waited *twenty months* before sending a rescue mission? The plot of a typical WoW expansion takes place in less time than this. Weren't they curious what the kingdom's exemplar knight was doing *in a mine* all this time, without supplies and without reporting back to the kingdom about his progress in his search? Why is the Tome of Divinity so important, anyway? And what is it doing in a mine?

    Whatever. This is a dungeon crawling mission where you command a limited number of troops. You discover that the Dead Mines have been overrun by ogres, find Lothar and his troops in a room at the end as special "wounded" units, and when you move your units near them, they turn into a unique Lothar unit and some archers. You escort them back to the Hostage Rescue Zone, and the whole ogre situation and the Tome of Divinity are not brought up again.

{% figure [caption:"I wondered at first why there was no unit name. Then I realized that &ldquo;Wounded&rdquo; *was* the unit name."] %}
![Wounded](/assets/wr/wc1_human4.png)
{% endfigure %}

* You destroy an orc base in the Forest of Elwynn, which is the key to securing the Borderlands.

    As an aside, I never understood why the forest was named "Elwynn". It sounds like "elven", which might imply that the local humans had some kind of myth that the forest was once inhabited by elves or something. But then in the next game, we discover that elves really exist in this world, but no subsequent lore mentions any kind of elves ever living anywhere near Elwynn Forest. It's actually fortunate that they never established the origin of the name and thus didn't have to retcon it.

* Northshire Abbey is overrun by "a band of warriors that have been convinced by enemy agents to fight against the crown". This is this campaign's obligatory mission where you fight your own faction; the enemy here is a faction of renegade humans that uses the same tech tree as you.

    This is another really strange setup. Unlike the orc campaign, where the [Civil Warcraft](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CivilWarcraft) mission has you betraying Blackhand, here you're fighting some unnamed human faction that's said to be in league with some unnamed enemy agents. What enemy agents? Orcs? It's frustratingly vague and is, once again, never brought up again.

    This mission also shows the limitations of the RTS format. Like in most other missions, the objective is to destroy all enemy units and buildings. But since these are human buildings, it feels like you're ruining perfectly good infrastructure just to spite the renegades.

[^cutscene]: "Cutscene" is a strong word for two limited-animation frames, but you know what I mean.
[^fiefdom]: In this kind of broad-strokes fantasy, it's usually not worth arguing over the intricacies of how the feudal system works or even if there is one, but even the most generic of fantasy stories tend to understand what regents are. As we'll see later, Warcraft 2 gets it right.
[^grand_hamlet]: Known as [Darkshire](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Darkshire) in the present day.
[^conjurer]: This is actually a Conjurer unit. They're all blue Gandalf knockoffs.
