We're almost finished with Warcraft 2. All that's left is the human campaign of Beyond the Dark Portal. But since this is my last chance to talk about that game, first I'd like to deal with a couple of topics about Warcraft 2 in general that don't really fit anywhere specific.


## Name'ing

Gul'dan. Ner'zhul. Kil'jaeden. Cho'gall.

Warcraft didn't start the tradition of apostrophized names. [Forgotten Realms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgotten_Realms) used the practice before, with its elves calling themselves *Tel'Quessir*. [Warhammer Fantasy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer_Fantasy) and its evil twin [Warhammer 40,000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer_40,000) also make use of such names, and did so before Samwise Didier ever coined the name "Warcraft".

As far as I can tell, apostrophized names in the Warcraft setting first appeared in Warcraft 2. There were none in Warcraft 1. Their appearance signified the start of Warcraft's journey towards being a pulp fantasy setting, and by now I would assume most players are desensitized to them and consider them a perfectly normal part of the setting, but it was not a given back then.

J.R.R. Tolkien is considered the progenitor of the modern fantasy genre, but as far as I know, you will not find any apostrophized names in any of his written works. Not a single one. As a linguist, he used typographical features in his names and constructed languages consistently and with full understanding of their meaning. Most of his character names are compound words consisting of two or more Elvish roots fused together into a single word without pauses; for example, the name *[Aragorn](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Aragorn)* means "revered king", from *ara-* "king" and *(n)gorn* "revered". When there *is* a pause in a name's pronunciation, it's indicated by a hyphen, such as *[Gil-galad](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Gil-galad)* "star" + "light", or written as two words, such as *[Minas Tirith](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Minas_Tirith)* "tower" + "watch".

In Warcraft, we find examples of all of these, *plus* the apostrophe.[^dorei] But where did the Warcraft writers get it from?

If [Tor.com](https://www.tor.com/2013/08/27/apostrophes-in-science-fiction-and-fantasy-names/) and [Prentice Pieces](https://prenticepieces.com/2022/08/21/apostrophes-in-names/) are to be believed, apostrophized names existed in pulp sci-fi since the 1930s, but the work that popularized them was Anne McCaffrey's *[Dragonriders of Pern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragonriders_of_Pern)* series. However, as far as I can tell, McCaffrey used the apostrophe in ways consistent with natural languages. In English and French, the apostrophe is used to indicate sounds dropped by contraction (don't = do not, d'Artagnan = de Artagnan), and in Pern, the apostrophe indicates that the dragonrider's name was shortened when they became a dragonrider (F'lar = Fallarnon). Later writers seem to have just copied the apostrophe because it "looked cool", making it indicate, at best, a pause like Warcraft does (which would be better indicated with a hyphen), or at worst, nothing at all.

I'm not saying the "fantasy apostrophe" should be abolished. By now, it's a fairly established typographic convention. But to me, it's a minor red flag that I might be looking at schlocky fantasy whose author just copied the convention unthinkingly because "it's fantasy, who cares?", possibly from someone who did the same.


## Color Me Curious

Like I said before, the various human kingdoms and orc clans in Warcraft 2 were invented largely to give lore flavor to player colors.

However, Warcraft 2 has eight player colors, while the Tides of Darkness manual lists only seven kingdoms and seven clans. The color yellow is not used for either side. It can, however, be selected in multiplayer, in which the yellow human and orc players were described as "Alliance Traitors" and "Horde Traitors", respectively.

In Beyond the Dark Portal, the humans are the same, but the seven orc clans are different. The color yellow is now used for the Laughing Skull clan, while it is blue orcs that are no longer used in the campaigns. Multiplayer doesn't display side names anymore, so the only way to see the name of the blue orcs is to look into the game files.

Turns out they're called the [Flowerpicker clan](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Flowerpicker_clan).

Which doesn't really have any significance. It's just a fun Easter egg.


## The Human Campaign


## Final Thoughts

If Warcraft 1 caught people's interest in Blizzard, Warcraft 2 catapulted the company to fame and fortune. It's not hard to see why. It improves on its predecessor in every aspect, effectively making it obsolete. It has aged better, and it's still played competitively.

*But...*

How many people who played Warcraft 2 in childhood actually remember its story?

Warcraft 2's gameplay and story aren't integrated. [They exist in different dimensions.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GameplayandStorySegregation) Most of the background lore is [in the manual](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AllThereInTheManual), and if you don't have it, you won't understand who any of the characters are. The story is told *between* missions, while the time spent playing the missions themselves is essentially story-free. The story is also hamstrung, especially in the orc campaign in Beyond the Dark Portal, by the need to justify RTS gameplay that in the end retains the same basic beats from mission to mission. As Shogganosh [said](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/warcraft-retrospective-a-blog-post-series-latest-issue-9-2024-01-07/474562/81) in the forum thread about this series:

> I see this expansion as emblematic of Blizzard’s teething pains as it struggled to transition from just making games with a little story as a backdrop to creating character-centric stories that are just as important as the gameplay, since it’s apparent that Beyond the Dark Portal wanted to be a story about a roster of heroes/villains for the Alliance and Horde, but the RTS gameplay about building bases and armies held it back and they hadn’t figured a way around it yet.
> 
> It might be worth thinking of Starcraft as a Warcraft 2.5 in this regard, where they managed to blend RTS gameplay and a character-focused story without stumbling into the same problems, before Warcraft 3 came out and they managed to make an RTS that revolved around a cast of main characters in terms of story and gameplay alike.

If our goal was to examing the evolution of [gameplay and story integration](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SlidingScaleOfGameplayAndStoryIntegration) in Blizzard RTS games, then looking at Starcraft, the evolutionary link between Warcraft 2 and Warcraft 3, would be the obvious thing to do next. However, this series is about Warcraft, so I'll only talk about Starcraft in passing, insofar as its design ideas were iterated on in subsequent Warcraft games.


### What's Next?

It seems that after Warcraft 2, Blizzard decided to retool their creation from a warfare setting into an adventure setting. As Shogganosh notes above, the Beyond the Dark Portal story *wanted* to be about heroes and their individual efforts, but was held back by the RTS format. I would say it was also held back by the setting itself as it existed at that point.

Warfare stories and adventure stories aren't told in a vacuum, and you can't easily tell one kind of story in a world designed for the other. So next time, I'll take a break from talking about specific games, and instead examine the implicit assumptions, the difference in buy-in and worldbuilding principles between warfare settings and adventure settings, and the problems this difference caused for the long-term evolution of Warcraft.

And after that? [The Game that Never Was](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Warcraft_Adventures:_Lord_of_the_Clans).


[^dorei]: What's worse, the patterns are inconsistent. Why is *kaldorei* written without an apostrophe, but *sin'dorei* with one? Why is *alara'shinu* written with an apostrophe but *Elune-adore* with a hyphen, and *ande'thoras-ethil* with both? Is there a method to this madness or are the writers just making it up as they go along?
