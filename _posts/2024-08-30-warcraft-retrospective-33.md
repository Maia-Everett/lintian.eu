Last time, we left Kael, Vashj, and their blood elves and naga as they leapt into a portal to the unknown. Now, on the other side, they behold...

## Thoughts on the Campaign

This campaign is okay. It's not my favorite, but it's short and sweet and of consistently good quality, having no missions that utterly blow my mind, but also none that I dislike.

I'm still a bit peeved that we didn't get a proper Alliance campaign, and even calling this the blood elf campaign is only half true, because the naga units steal the show so frequently. In hindsight, this could be called the [Illidari](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Illidari) campaign.

Kael's journey, in a sense, echoes Arthas's. We see a man put in a no-win situation, resorting to increasingly desperate measures to save his people. However, Arthas was lured into a deliberate trap laid by the Lich King, and became his soulless puppet. Kael simply ended up between a rock and a hard place. Vashj may have nudged him by feeding him information selectively, but at the end he made all the decisions himself, of his own free will, and voluntarily pledged his allegiance to Illidan. By the end of the story, he's still himself --- only a hardened version of the Kael we saw in the night elf campaign.

This campaign introduced the concept of magic addiction, which became important to overall Warcraft lore, and more importantly, in a rather questionable moment, retconned a shard of Draenor into having survived the planet's explosion. In addition, it gave us the anti-hero trio of Illidan, Kael and Vashj, with good chemistry between them. I sure hope that in [the next game](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_The_Burning_Crusade) they appear in, they will be portrayed as complex characters driven by believable motivations!

Next up is the undead campaign, which concludes the main storyline of The Frozen Throne. Because of its sheer length, I'll likely split it into three posts rather than the usual two. Arthas is back in the game, and we're going to see the fallout of Illidan's failed attempt to destroy the Lich King.
