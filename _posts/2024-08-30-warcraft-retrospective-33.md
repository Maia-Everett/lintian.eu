Last time, we left Kael, Vashj, and their blood elves and naga as they leapt into a portal to the unknown. Now, on the other side, they behold...

## The Dusts of Outland

Our heroes are transported to some kind of red barren realm full of floating islands, and Kael asks Vashj what this desolate place is. It turns out that...

Wow. That's quite a bombshell the writers have dropped on us here. There's a lot to untangle.

Previously, in Tides of Darkness, the Dark Portal was closed. Then in Beyond the Dark Portal, Khadgar not just re-closed it, but [sealed it](/2024/01/14/warcraft-retrospective-10/) beyond all reasonable doubt. Then the Alliance Expedition left Draenor through one of the dimensional rifts just before Draenor exploded. And now we're learning that a good chunk of it actually survived?

I remember how, when news surfaced that The Frozen Throne would return to Draenor, the community I was in began speculating how it would be possible. Were we going to time travel into the past? Did we find a duplicate of it? Or perhaps it only *mostly* exploded, but a shard survived? It's funny how, in the end, Blizzard used all three of these ideas --- two of them, much later, [in the same WoW expansion](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_Warlords_of_Draenor).

Blizzard just can't let go of Draenor, which brings into the question the point of blowing it up in the first place. Of course, they might have simply regretted it.

We're not even going to do anything particularly Draenor-y here. Here in Outland, we're concerned with finding Illidan (Vashj knows that he's here, but not why). We're not dealing with orcs (much) nor with the Alliance Expedition (which [definitely isn't even here](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Honor_Hold), right?). This place could just as easily have been any Legion-occupied world, and all the map designers would have to do would be replacing the orc models with demon ones.

Whatever. Let's begin...


## The Search for Illidan

## Illidan's Task

## Thoughts on the Campaign

This campaign is okay. It's not my favorite, but it's short and sweet and of consistently good quality, having no missions that utterly blow my mind, but also none that I dislike.

I'm still a bit peeved that we didn't get a proper Alliance campaign, and even calling this the blood elf campaign is only half true, because the naga units steal the show so frequently. In hindsight, this could be called the [Illidari](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Illidari) campaign.

Kael's journey, in a sense, echoes Arthas's. We see a man put in a no-win situation, resorting to increasingly desperate measures to save his people. However, Arthas was lured into a deliberate trap laid by the Lich King, and became his soulless puppet. Kael simply ended up between a rock and a hard place. Vashj may have nudged him by feeding him information selectively, but at the end he made all the decisions himself, of his own free will, and voluntarily pledged his allegiance to Illidan. By the end of the story, he's still himself --- only a hardened version of the Kael we saw in the night elf campaign.

This campaign introduced the concept of magic addiction, which became important to overall Warcraft lore, and more importantly, in a rather questionable moment, retconned a shard of Draenor into having survived the planet's explosion. In addition, it gave us the anti-hero trio of Illidan, Kael and Vashj, with good chemistry between them. I sure hope that in [the next game](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/World_of_Warcraft:_The_Burning_Crusade) they appear in, they will be portrayed as complex characters driven by believable motivations!

Next up is the undead campaign, which concludes the main storyline of The Frozen Throne. Because of its sheer length, I'll likely split it into three posts rather than the usual two. Arthas is back in the game, and we're going to see the fallout of Illidan's failed attempt to destroy the Lich King.

...But seriously, what happened to Maiev?
