And so we get to the final campaign of Reign of Chaos: the night elf one. And... oh boy, it's going to be awkward for me to talk about it.

It's no secret that I like night elves. This website is, after all, named after a night elf [roleplay character of mine](https://lintian.eu/lintian/). It's furthermore no secret that I like elves as a fantasy concept, in general --- though it might surprise people who know me as the [Argent Dawn realm forum](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/c/argent-dawn/190)'s resident elf-lover --- that this basically only applies to two races in all of fantasy that I know of. Most varieties of elves that have been invented by fantasy writers over the past few decades --- at least those that are actually *called* elves[^races] --- leave me either annoyed or indifferent, except for exactly two of them: Tolkien elves, and night elves.

Before you raise your pitchforks (or bows), let me say a few words in my defense.

## An Abridged, Oversimplified, and Highly Inaccurate History of Elves

{% figure [caption:"*Ängsälvor* (Swedish &ldquo;Meadow Elves&rdquo;) by [Nils Blommér](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nils_Blomm%C3%A9r) (1850)"] %}

{% endfigure %}

In the beginning, there was [Germanic folklore and mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elf). I'm not actually qualified to talk about it, and at any rate, any cursory overview of a folkloric concept will inevitably involve simplifications and generalizations. Premodern conceptions of elves have apparently ranged from diminutive to human-sized; they have at various times been conflated with fairies or used as am umbrella term for mythological beings that included forest spirits, dwarves, and even trolls; and then there's Norse mythology with its [distinctions] between light elves *(Ljósálfar)*, dark elves *(Dökkálfar)* and black elves *(Svartálfar)*, the latter two of which may have been the same or different, or they may have been dwarves, or distinct from them. It's a bit of a mess.

What's important for our purposes is what I've already mentioned before when [talking about orcs](https://lintian.eu/2024/01/28/warcraft-retrospective-12/): mythological beings were conceptualized as an [Other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_(philosophy)) defined primarily by their interactions with humans, part of the wild, unknown world beyond the safety of civilization. Elves could help or hinder humans; they could charm human onlookers, or bring diseases upon the townsfolk, or kidnap human children and replace them with changelings, but at any rate they were *them*, they were *other*, and storytellers' audiences weren't asked to put themselves in their shoes.

![Ängsälvor](/assets/wr/Rackham_elves.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

From Elizabethan times onwards, thanks to Shakespeare, the words "elf" and "fairy" ended up being used somewhat interchangeably for diminutive beings, an image that by Victorian times got codified as tiny human-like beings with butterfly wings and often pointy ears. In modern D&D terminology, we'd call them [pixies](forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Pixie). This was the image that Tolkien's contemporaries in the early-mid 20th century tended to associate with the word "elf", much to his annoyance.

And then, taking inspiration from Germanic mythology, Tolkien wrote [*his* elves](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Elf), forever changing the associations of the word and in effect creating a whole new archetype.


### The Sundering of Tolkien Elves

{% figure [caption:"And those who choose to travel west to the undying lands of Valinor shall enjoy bliss eternal in the light of the Two Trees! We also provide dental insurance."] %}
![Teleri](/assets/wr/Steamey_-_Ossë_and_the_Teleri.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Tolkien drew from [a variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elves_in_Middle-earth) of mutually contradictory inspirations, including the aforementioned Norse *Ljósálfar* and *Dökkálfar* and Irish [Tuatha Dé Danann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuatha_D%C3%A9_Danann), and synthesized them with original elements of his own, suggested in part by his own Catholic religion. The end result was different in many ways from both his mythological inspirations and the armada of imitators that followed, and is far beyond the scope of this blog; I'll focus on the details that matter for the discussion of Warcraft.

In [Tolkien's world](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Arda), elves are a race of beings much like humans, but taller, more conventionally beautiful[^ears], stronger and wiser, immune to aging and sickness and thus capable of living [forever, barring accidents](https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/The_War_Games_(TV_story)), and capable of superior craftsmanship honed over their long lives to such an extent that it resembled magic. The first elves were created directly by [the one supreme god](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Eru) before the Sun and the Moon existed, so the first thing they saw when they awakened were the stars, which they've come to love forever after.

Prior to that, the ["pagan gods"](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Valar) or, if you will, demiurges of the world, creators of the land, sea and wildlife, had a series of fierce battles with their [fallen brother](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Melkor), the Satanic arch-villain of the entire setting, during which their original design for the world --- a single continent with a [great lake](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Great_Lake) in is center --- was broken into two continents with the Great Sea between them. Forsaking the eastern continent --- known in later times as [Middle-earth](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Middle-earth) --- to the Enemy to do as he pleased, the gods retreated to the [western continent](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Aman), where they built their earthly paradise known as [Valinor](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Valinor).

{% figure [caption:"Looks familiar, doesn't it?"] %}
![Arda](/assets/wr/Arda.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

After the elves awakened, the gods invited them over the sea to dwell with them in that western paradise, and that caused a divide among the elves. [Some](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Avari) refused outright. Those who agreed to travel west came to call themselves [Eldar](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Eldar), or "people of the stars". Those were in turn split into three nations even during the journey, and then [some of them](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Sindar) stayed behind in Middle-earth, never completing the journey to Valinor. And of those Eldar who did reach Valinor, due to a *complicated* series of events, [a faction](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Exile_of_the_Noldor) later returned to Middle-earth and were, for a while, forbidden by the gods to come back to Valinor. These exiles founded kingdoms of their own, passing much of their knowledge to the humans of Middle-earth.

Tolkien was a linguist, and a major motivation for worldbuilding, for him, was constructing a world that his invented languages could exist in. For this reason, the geographical history of his world was dictated in part by linguistic considerations. Originally, all elves spoke [one language](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Primitive_Quendian)[^primitive_quendian], which, though millennia of separation between elven peoples and nations, split into [Quenya](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Quenya) in Valinor and [Sindarin](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Sindarin) in Middle-earth[^languages]; the Great Sea, as a natural geographical barrier, is thus an in-universe justification for the existence of two languages, as well as divergent cultures.

That last point bears elaborating. Tolkien elves are not a single racial monoculture; it would be highly inaccurate to say that they all live in forests and practice archery. But they're *also* not divided into distinct species, like Warcraft's night elves and high elves or Forgotten Realms' sun elves, drow, and sea elves. Like real-life humans, they're all biologically the same species divided into *nations*, each with its own distinct culture. [Some](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Silvan_Elves) indeed live in forests and are renowned for their woodland archers, [others](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Teleri) live by the shore and are famous for their sailors and shipwrights, and [others still](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Noldor) live in magnificent cities and have produced great artisans and scholars.

The race as a whole, as such, defies easy generalization --- in my opinion, at least. Tolkien elves are individuals and display a variety of personality traits, virtues, and flaws, even within a single culture. [Some](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Elrond) are regal and thoughtful while [others](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/L%C3%BAthien) are playful and whimsical; [some](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Finrod) are open-minded and compassionate while [others](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Thingol) are xenophobic and quick to anger; and so on and so forth. If I were to name some general traits, I'd say that Tolkien elves are slow to change and to adapt to change, and are largely content for the world to remain undisturbed; they don't seek to break or dominate the wills of others; and while some elves throughout history fell to hubris and selfishness and committed atrocities like mass murder, genocide, and rape, [very few](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Maeglin) have ever willingly served Evil as a cosmic force.

Mind you, all this is known from Tolkien's posthumously published prequel book, *[The Silmarillion](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/The_Silmarillion)*, which is Elvish for "Warcraft Chronicles of Westeros". By the time of *The Lord of the Rings*, the few elves still left in Middle-earth are a remnant of a remnant, and the reason they come off as such goodies-two-shoes is because everyone more impatient, reckless, or malicious has long either died or sailed away. The remaining ones are world-weary, having lived for many millennia in a fading and decaying world while they themselves stayed unchanging. They're associated with twilight, while daytime is the domain of humans, the younger race, and of all the gods they most revere [Elbereth](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Varda), the Queen of the Stars, who is associated with the night sky and with hope in the deepest darkness.

Now, the reason I'm bothering to say all this is because I listed specifically the facts that are going to be relevant to Warcraft, going forward, and we'll soon see the thematic parallels. I'm also, once again, trying to show that Tolkien put a lot more nuance and thought into his world than might be evident at first sight, and avoided many of the pitfalls of fantasy writers who came after him. He drew from many sources and, in turn, left his successors many themes to draw from in turn. More than that, by making his elves protagonists and viewpoint characters, and by creating in-universe writings from their perspective, he let us see the world through their eyes. In Tolkien's world, nonhumans like elves, dwarves and hobbits are not Other, but people with rich inner worlds of their own.

...And then of course, most later writers disregarded this worldbuilding and remembered [Legolas](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Legolas), so he became the default template for the ISO Standard Fantasy Elf going forward.


### After Tolkien

{% figure [caption:"We greet you, Earthlings. Take us to your leader!"] %}
![D&D elves](/assets/wr/D&D_elves.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

As we know, *The Lord of the Rings* was so popular that Tolkien's conception of elves thoroughly displaced everything that came before it in the public consciousness. But all too often, later writers fell into shallow stereotypes.

From my experience, post-Tolkien elves tend to fall into two broad categories. On one hand we have writers whose elves or [thinly-veiled elf-stand-ins](https://james-camerons-avatar.fandom.com/wiki/Na%27vi) are unrealistically perfect, live in a [Mary Suetopia](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StrawUtopia), and conspicuously share the author's exact real-life views on social issues, or at least views the author approves of. They can be devoutly religious, or they can be [atheists and vegetarians](https://inheritance.fandom.com/wiki/Elf); prudish or sexually liberated; or outright ecoterrorists if the author wants to preach environmentalism. In any case, we're supposed to find them sympathetic.

The other kind of annoying elves lean not on moralizing, but on the power fantasy aspect. These elves are better than you at everything, dear reader, and [they want you to know it](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CantArgueWithElves). They're stronger than you, faster than you, smarter than you, prettier than you, and better than you at any setting-relevant skill you can name. It comes off as smug and condescending, and at times strays uncomfortably close to a Master Race eugenics fantasy. Bonus points if they act like entitled human teenagers with none of the supposed wisdom that their unfathomably high age is supposed to bring.

And then there's D&D, as its own thing. As a roleplaying game or, rather, a toolkit for hosting roleplaying games, it's not really *about* anything; it brings you the building blocks, but the adventure author is supposed to assemble them into a game that hopefully weaves a story *about* something. At first, Gary Gygax, who is given [way more credit for his part in creating D&D than he deserves](https://kotaku.com/dungeons-deceptions-the-first-d-d-players-push-back-1837516834), favored humans over nonhumans and believed D&D should have been about humans first and foremost; originally "elf" was both a race *and* a class, so you could be a human fighter, or a human cleric, or... an elf, period. And then D&D went overboard and started adding new elf varieties for each environment you can think of --- as actual *biologically different races*, each with its own shade of technicolor skin color. And so now we have sun elves, moon elves, star elves, wood elves, wild elves, grey elves, sea elves, winged elves, and can this madness please stop before, of all the elf cliches, some video game developer copies *this* one?

...Oops, [too late](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Elf).

And that wasn't enough. Of all of D&D's multicolored varieties of elves, one managed to take off to the point of inspiring imitators of its own: the [drow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drow), created by --- who else? --- the notorious [misogynist, biological determinist](https://kotaku.com/the-struggle-to-bring-more-women-into-game-development-1783683864) and lover of the concept of evil races, Gary Gygax. As one of the monster races that players are supposed to have no moral qualms indiscriminately killing, drow, also called dark elves, are a universally dark-skinned and near-universally evil race that lives underground and has a [fashion sense](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/8/80/Constant_Guardian.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20181003144633) that I can most charitably describe as "not even disguising the author's fetish".

It's telling that when one Warcraft 3 developer suggested making "dark elves" a playable faction (which ultimately led to the creation of night elves), [none of them wanted to go with drow](http://web.archive.org/web/20010205012800/http://www.zdnet.com/gamespot/stories/previews/0,10869,2667651,00.html).


### Enter Warcraft

Warcraft 2 made a big jump from faux-Christian humans against hellish orcs --- as seen in Warcraft 1 --- to a more typical roster of fantasy races, introducing elves, dwarves and gnomes for the Alliance, and trolls, ogres and goblins for the Horde. Traditional adventurer races versus traditional monster races. It made sense.

It seems to me, however, that nobody was interested in actually fleshing out Quel'Thalas. The logic was, it seems, that since they were going for a high fantasy setting, it needed elves in the same way that Superman needs those little red underpants outside his costume: [which is to say, not at all, but it's always there anyway](https://www.shamusyoung.com/twentysidedtale/?p=27926). I mean, pretty much the only things we knew about Quel'Thalas prior to Warcraft 3 were that they had archers and druids (the latter of whom are conspicuously absent in Warcraft 3), provided the Alliance with destroyer ships and lumber mills, and had a history of enmity with the trolls. In Warcraft 2, they weren't yet known as "high elves", just "elves", with no reason to believe that there were more kinds of them. And then, throughout all the Warcraft media until and counting Reign of Chaos, we got exactly *three* named characters from Quel'Thalas: Alleria, Vereesa, and Sylvanas. And they --- what a coincidence! --- were all rangers, and at that point, pretty much interchangeable.

And then, with Warcraft 3, came the night elves.

{% figure [caption:"Man, that early concept art was *wild*. If anything, far more savage than what we got."] %}
![Night elf concept art](/assets/wr/Night_Elves_-_Concept.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

With them came a lot of lore (by RTS standards) that wasn't, strictly speaking, *necessary*, but was there anyway --- a sign that the worldbuilders were enjoying their work. They have unique and consistent aesthetics that aren't borrowed from ISO Standard Fantasy Elves, but aren't imported wholesale from a single real-life culture either, instead borrowing from a variety of real-life cultures and mixing them into something new and fresh. They weave in some of the Tolkienian themes mentioned earlier in a way that shows *understanding*, not just mindless imitation. And in-game, it all works together: the lore, the visuals, the music, and the characters.

Night elves are very popular to this day and are still one of the most lore-rich races in the setting, which makes it hard to believe that their creation was basically a happy accident.

When brainstorming playable factions for Warcraft 3, the developers [debated](http://web.archive.org/web/20010205012800/http://www.zdnet.com/gamespot/stories/previews/0,10869,2667651,00.html) whether to make elves and dwarves their own factions. There was no majority agreement on making "traditional" elves a standalone faction until someone suggested dark elves. Since they didn't want to do D&D drow either, they combined "the best of wood elves and dark elves" into a single race. Despite the developers not going with drow, night elves had more drow influences early on than were retained in the finished game, for example, riding giant insects; in Warcraft 3 as we know it, the only elements that survive are dark skin and strict gender roles with a matriarchal bent.

As for their history, as outlined in the manual, I can't help but wonder if one of the Warcraft 3  writers was a fan of *The Silmarillion*.

{% figure [caption:"The Maelstrom swirls at the former site of the capital of a colonialist empire whose ruler's hubris sundered the world."] %}
![WC3 manual world map](/assets/wr/wc3_manual_map_world.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

The Titans, the godlike "orderers" of the land, sea and wildlife, were betrayed by their [fallen brother](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Sargeras), the Satanic arch-villain of the entire setting, who was ultimately responsible for breaking their original design for the world --- a single continent with a [great lake](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Well_of_Eternity) in is center --- into two major continents with the Great Sea between them. Forsaking the eastern continent, the night elves --- who called themselves *kaldorei*, or "children of the stars" --- retreated to the western continent, [Kalimdor](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Kalimdor). There they dwell, until mariners from across the sea will come to enlist their help in saving the world.

The night elves once had a glorious civilization, but it was destroyed in the Sundering. Those who remain now are world-weary, having lived for many millennia in a fading and decaying world while they themselves stayed unchanging. They're associated with twilight, while daytime is the domain of the younger races, and of all the gods they most revere [Elune](https://warcraft.wiki.gg/wiki/Elune), Mother Moon, who is associated with the night sky and with hope in the deepest darkness.

It's not a perfect match, and a lot of it could be just coincidence, convergent evolution, or ideas floating in the air. But I really do wonder.


## Eternity's End

{% figure [caption:"To all of my children in whom Life flows abundant..."] %}
![Eternity's End](/assets/wr/20240519160649_1.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

And so we get to the night elf campaign, "Eternity's End". It's a rather ominous title --- after all, isn't an eternity by definition endless? I wonder what can possibly--

<figure class="character-portrait">
<img src="/assets/wr/question_my_choice_of_attire.jpg" width="300" /><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

...Wait a minute, what is that archer wearing? Or rather, why is she wearing so little?

Over my years of roleplay, I've heard plenty of in-character excuses for Sentinel "armor", and none of them really satisfy me. It's for mobility. Night elves don't have prudish Western decency mores. Sentinel archers rely on being hidden, so if they're caught in melee they're screwed anyway, armor or no armor. And so on and so forth.

Thing is, these are [Thermian arguments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxV8gAGmbtk). Warcraft 3 is not a historical documentary, it's a mass market video game taking place in a make-believe world. None of these justifications explain the massive shoulderpads and gloves that protect the archer's shoulders and forearms *and nothing else*.

Since it's a 2002 game, I really don't think any thought process involved in this design went deeper than "Dude, look at the cleavage on that hot chick! 10/10 would totally bang."

You can't even claim that it's specifically a night elven cultural trait that visually distinguishes them from the other races. Here are Jaina and Sylvanas's in-game models.

{% figure [caption:""] %}
![Jaina and Sylvanas](/assets/wr/wc3_jaina_sylvanas.jpg)
{% endfigure %}

Why do so many women in this game like to show off their cleavage on the battlefield?

You want to portray athletic and assertive women, that's fine. Good, even! Make them wear something sensible that still signals these traits. In a modern setting, in everyday life, a tank top would be appropriate. On a fantasy battlefield... some kind of sleeveless leather vest, maybe. Whatever. I'm not an armor expert. In-universe, I'm sure that a culture with ten thousand years of experience in armorcraft would come up with something that both doesn't restrict the wearer's movements *and* provides actual protection.

Moving on...

[^races]: There are some thematically elf-adjacent races that I do like, but they're neither called elves nor look like stereotypical fantasy elves.

[^ears]: And Tolkien *probably* [didn't picture them](https://middle-earth.xenite.org/do-tolkiens-elves-have-pointy-ears/) with pointy ears; at the very least, this detail is never mentioned in his stories and appears to be a later fan conflation with Victorian elves and fairies. There's also a textual instance of [a human](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Nienor) disguising herself as an elf in a traveling company of actual elves, which would be difficult if the two races could be easily distinguished by ear shape.

[^primitive_quendian]: Which can be thought of as their equivalent of [Proto-Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language).

[^languages]: Plus a few less important ones that Tolkien didn't develop in detail.
