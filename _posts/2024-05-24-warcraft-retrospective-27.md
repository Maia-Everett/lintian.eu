And so we get to the final campaign of Reign of Chaos: the night elf one. And... oh boy, it's going to be awkward for me to talk about it.

It's no secret that I like night elves. This website is, after all, named after a night elf [roleplay character of mine](https://lintian.eu/lintian/). It's furthermore no secret that I like elves as a fantasy concept, in general --- though it might surprise people who know me as the [Argent Dawn realm forum](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/c/argent-dawn/190)'s resident elf-lover that this basically only applies to two races in all of fantasy that I know of. Most varieties of elves that have been invented by fantasy writers over the past few decades leave me either annoyed or indifferent, except for exactly two of them: Tolkien elves, and night elves.

Before you raise your pitchforks (or bows), let me say a few words in my defense.

## An Abridged, Oversimplified, and Highly Inaccurate History of Elves

{% figure [caption:"*Ängsälvor* (Swedish &ldquo;Meadow Elves&rdquo;) by [Nils Blommér](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nils_Blomm%C3%A9r) (1850)"] %}

In the beginning, there was [Germanic folklore and mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elf). I'm not actually qualified to talk about it, and at any rate, any cursory overview of a folkloric concept will inevitably involve simplifications and generalizations. Premodern conceptions of elves have apparently ranged from diminutive to human-sized; they have at various times been conflated with fairies or used as am umbrella term for mythological beings that included forest spirits, dwarves, and even trolls; and then there's Norse mythology with its [distinctions] between light elves *(Ljósálfar)*, dark elves *(Dökkálfar)* and black elves *(Svartálfar)*, the latter two of which may have been the same or different, or they may have been dwarves, or distinct from them. It's a bit of a mess.

What's important for our purposes is what I've already mentioned before when [talking about orcs](https://lintian.eu/2024/01/28/warcraft-retrospective-12/): mythological beings were conceptualized as an [Other](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Other_(philosophy)) defined primarily by their interactions with humans, part of the wild, unknown world beyond the safety of civilization. Elves could help or hinder humans; they could charm human onlookers, or bring diseases upon the townsfolk, or kidnap human children and replace them with changelings, but at any rate they were *them*, they were *other*, and storytellers' audiences weren't asked to put themselves in their shoes.

From Elizabethan times onwards, thanks to Shakespeare, the words "elf" and "fairy" ended up being used somewhat interchangeably for diminutive beings, an image that by Victorian times got codified as tiny human-like beings with butterfly wings and often pointy ears. In modern D&D terminology, we'd call them [pixies](forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Pixie). This was the image that Tolkien's contemporaries in the early-mid 20th century tended to associate with the word "elf", much to his annoyance.

And then, taking inspiration from Germanic mythology, Tolkien wrote [*his* elves](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Elf), forever changing the associations of the word and in effect creating a whole new archetype.


### The Sundering of Tolkien Elves

Tolkien drew from [a variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elves_in_Middle-earth) of mutually contradictory inspirations, including the aforementioned Norse *Ljósálfar* and *Dökkálfar* and Irish [Tuatha Dé Danann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuatha_D%C3%A9_Danann), and synthesized them with original elements of his own, suggested in part by his own Catholic religion. The end result was different in many ways from both his mythological inspirations and the armada of imitators that followed, and is far beyond the scope of this blog; I'll focus on the details that matter for the discussion of Warcraft.

In [Tolkien's world](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Arda), elves are a race of beings much like humans, but taller, more conventionally beautiful[^ears], stronger and wiser, immune to aging and sickness and thus capable of living [forever, barring accidents](https://tardis.fandom.com/wiki/The_War_Games_(TV_story)), and capable of superior craftsmanship honed over their long lives to such an extent that it resembled magic. The first elves were created directly by [the one supreme god](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Eru) before the Sun and the Moon existed, so the first thing they saw when they awakened were the stars, which they've come to love forever after.

Prior to that, the ["pagan gods"](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Valar) or, if you will, demiurges of the world, creators of the land, sea and wildlife, had a series of fierce battles with their [fallen brother](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Melkor), the Satanic arch-villain of the entire setting, during which their original design for the world --- a single continent with a [great lake](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Great_Lake) in is center --- was broken into two continents with the Great Sea between them. Forsaking the eastern continent --- known in later times as [Middle-earth](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Middle-earth) --- to the Enemy to do as he pleased, the gods retreated to the [western continent](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Aman), where they built their earthly paradise known as [Valinor](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Valinor).

{% figure [caption:"Looks familiar, doesn't it?"] %}

{% endfigure %}

After the elves awakened, the gods invited them over the sea to dwell with them in that western paradise, and that caused a divide among the elves. [Some](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Avari) refused outright. Those who agreed to travel west came to call themselves [Eldar](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Eldar), or "people of the stars". Those were in turn split into three nations even during the journey, and then [some of them](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Sindar) stayed behind in Middle-earth, never completing the journey to Valinor. And of those Eldar who did reach Valinor, due to a *complicated* series of events, [a faction](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Noldor) later returned to Middle-earth and were, for a while, forbidden by the gods to come back to Valinor. These [exiles](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Exile_of_the_Noldor) founded kingdoms of their own, passing much of their knowledge to the humans of Middle-earth.

Tolkien was a linguist, and a major motivation for worldbuilding, for him, was constructing a world that his invented languages could exist in. For this reason, the geographical history of his world was dictated in part by linguistic considerations. Originally, all elves spoke [one language](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Primitive_Quendian)[^primitive_quendian], which, though millennia of separation between elven peoples and nations, split into [Quenya](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Quenya) in Valinor and [Sindarin](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Sindarin) in Middle-earth[^languages]; the Great Sea, as a natural geographical barrier, is thus an in-universe justification for the existence of two languages, as well as divergent cultures.

That last point bears elaborating. Tolkien elves are not a single racial monoculture; it would be highly inaccurate to say that they all live in forests and practice archery. But they're *also* not divided into distinct species, like Warcraft's night elves and high elves or Forgotten Realms' sun elves, drow, and sea elves. Like real-life humans, they're all biologically the same species divided into *nations*, each with its own distinct culture.



## Enemy at the Gates


## Daughters of the Moon


## The Awakening of Stormrage


## The Druids Arise


Next up: a very, *very* iconic character enters the scene.


[^ears]: And Tolkien *probably* [didn't picture them](https://middle-earth.xenite.org/do-tolkiens-elves-have-pointy-ears/) with pointy ears; at the very least, this detail is never mentioned in his stories and appears to be a later fan conflation with Victorian elves and fairies. There's also a textual instance of [a human](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Nienor) disguising herself as an elf in a traveling company of actual elves, which would be difficult if the two races could be easily distinguished by ear shape.

[^primitive_quendian]: Which can be thought of as their equivalent of [Proto-Indo-European](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_language).

[^languages]: Plus a few less important ones that Tolkien didn't develop in detail.
