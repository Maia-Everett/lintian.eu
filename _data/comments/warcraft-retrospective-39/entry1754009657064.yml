message: "Warcraft Fan here (mostly of the RTS games though I also learned some lore from my cousin who played World of Warcraft and some books), and I want to say thank you for writing this retrospective on the Warcraft Franchise. Though influenced by the past franchises such as Dungeons & Dragons as well as Warhammer Fantasy, I love that you also note how it tried to carve its own image and break away from the Tolkien-esque mold of past fantasy works. The fact that it has influenced other works can't be emphasized enough and while Blizzard may no longer be the same entity it was of years past, it should still be remembered for trying to bring life to a genre that was at risk of stagnation. \r\n\r\nOnce again, I thank you for writing these posts, even if I am blinded a bit by nostalgia."
