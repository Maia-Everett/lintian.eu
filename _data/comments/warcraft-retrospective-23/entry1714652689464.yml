  Amidst a bit of a nostalgic reacquaintance with "Warcraft III", I discovered
  this series a few days ago and have already reached this entry. As a former
  reader of Shamus Young's work, it's wonderful to see someone take inspiration
  from it â€” and kind of exciting to read as it progresses. A very cool work
  that's inspired me pop in my old CDs again. :)
