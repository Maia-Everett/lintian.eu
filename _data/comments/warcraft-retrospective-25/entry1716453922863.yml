  Something seems a little strange about the arc showing the orcs moving away
  from the "this race is always evil" involving several other, new races that
  are always evil. On the other hand, maybe part of the reason I really dislike
  it is just because I'm the sort of person whose D&D characters have included
  multiple centaurs and no orcs.
