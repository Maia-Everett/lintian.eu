message: "A little funny that Warcraft would rename units over IP conflicts with WHFB when WHFB would wind up being canned at least partially over concerns that the IP wasn't defensible.\r\n\r\nAside from being a green leader of orcs who winds up starting a blood feud with some elves Grom Hellscream and Grom the Paunch certainly don't have much in common. Probably for the better that Warcraft didn't try to implement 'a man so fat he needs to be carried into battle on a cart is (still!) a great champion and slayer of his foes'. Twice."
