### Third-Party Content

This is mostly a blog about video games, so it includes many screenshots and quotations from someone else's works --- mostly video games, but also films and TV series. The sources of screenshots are normally credited at the bottom of the page where the screenshot is included. Screenshots from Warcraft works, as well as the video game Final Fantasy XIV, are normally not explicitly credited; the copyright holders for Warcraft and Final Fantasy are Blizzard Entertainment Inc. and Square Enix Co., Ltd., respectively.

These third-party works are not subject to the Creative Commons license linked above.
